Three Chilean survivors of clergy sex abuse said they are encouraged after private meetings with Pope Francis at the Vatican.

The conversations, which took place over the weekend at the pope’s Casa Santa Marta residence, were arranged by the Vatican after Francis received harsh criticism for his handling of the sex abuse crisis in Chile.

On Twitter, José Andrés Murillo said he tried to emphasize to the pope that the abuse he had suffered as a teenager at the hands of a pedophile priest was specifically an “abuse of power.” He wrote that he had spoken to Francis for two hours. Another victim, James Hamilton, tweeted that his conversation with Francis was “enormously constructive” and that he left it “very happy and satisfied.”

Juan Carlos Cruz, the third victim, wrote on Twitter that he had spoken privately with Francis for more than 2½ hours on Sunday.

“He listened to me with great respect, affection and closeness, like a father. We talked about many subjects,” Cruz wrote. “Today I have more hope in the future of our church... even though the task is enormous.”

Before the meetings, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke announced that the Holy See will not be releasing official press statements about the conversations, since Francis’ primary intention was to “listen to the victims, ask them for forgiveness and respect the confidentiality of these meetings.”

Francis had previously received sharp rebuke from clergy sex abuse victims and their advocates after he was caught on tape in January accusing the men of slander against Chile’s Bishop Juan Barros. Murillo, Hamilton and Cruz claim Barros witnessed abuse carried out by the Rev. Fernando Karadima but did nothing to stop it. The three men testified against Karadima during a Vatican trial that eventually led to the priest’s conviction in 2011. Barros continues to deny knowing about the abuse.

Francis appointed Barros to lead the diocese of Osorno in 2015 despite protestations from Chilean politicians and local Catholic clergy.

Earlier this month, Francis admitted that he had made “serious errors” in handling Chile’s sex abuse scandal due to a “lack of truthful and balanced information.” In a rare move, he also summoned all 32 of Chile’s bishops to Rome during the third week of May to discuss the allegations against Barros.

Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, an organization that tracks clergy sex abuse worldwide, said that she was moved by the “graciousness” of the three men after their meetings with Francis.

“Given the years of silence and disrespect they’ve endured from church officials, including Pope Francis, they could have refused the pope’s invitation,” she told HuffPost in an email. “But always, Juan Carlos Cruz, Jimmy Hamilton and José Andrés Murillo focus on the bigger picture ― in this case, the plight of the many Chilean victims who have no voice, and the ongoing safety crisis in Chilean parishes and Catholic schools.”

Barrett Doyle cautioned that speaking with survivors is a start, but it doesn’t constitute change. She hopes that, along with removing Barros and other Chilean clergy who were aware of Karadima’s crimes, Francis will also create an efficient system for investigating and disciplining bishops who have enabled child abuse.Things were out of odor at a university library in Melbourne, Australia, on Saturday afternoon, with fears of a gas leak.

But the smell that aroused suspicions was no leaky pipe. It was a notoriously stinky fruit.

Around 500 students and staffers were evacuated from the RMIT University library so that 40 firefighters, including masked crews, could investigate the source of the smell, according to the Herald Sun. The culprit was a durian left rotting in a cupboard, Melbourne’s Metropolitan Fire Brigade said in a release.

Although aficionados relish durians for their creamy, sweet interior, the fruits are so polarizing that they’re banned from Singapore’s subway system and many hotels around Asia, according to Time.The world’s largest active geyser has erupted three times in the past six weeks and scientists don’t know why.

The latest event, which was photographed by a visitor to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, occurred on Friday.

The last time there was a major eruption of the Steamboat Geyser was in 2014. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, all of this year’s eruptions have been smaller than the 2014 event.

Although scientists can’t explain why the geyser has become so active, they don’t believe the eruptions in the northwest section of the park signal pending trouble with the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone.

“There is nothing to indicate that any sort of volcanic eruption is imminent,” Michael Poland, head of the USGS’s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Reuters.

Three @YellowstoneNPS #SteamboatGeyser water eruptions in 6 weeks!

Mar 15, Apr 19 & Apr 27. @UUSS_Quake_Info seismic data indicate eruption starting at 6:30 a.m. local time. All 2018 events have smaller signal than major water eruptions in 2013 and 2014. pic.twitter.com/rynJG4eppd — USGS Volcanoes🌋 (@USGSVolcanoes) April 27, 2018

Steamboat, located in the park’s Norris Geyser Basin, can shoot a column of hot water up to 300 feet into the air. Its eruptions have always been unpredictable.

Yellowstone’s volcanic plateau is home to the world’s largest, most spectacular hydrothermal system of colorful springs, thermal ponds and geysers. The park is on top of a volcanic caldera — or crater — and vast underground chambers of magma flow miles beneath the surface. Geysers erupt when magma heats water that has seeped underground.

The park’s most famous geyser, Old Faithful, is a fraction of the size of Steamboat and erupts every 45 to 125 minutes.

As for the Steamboat Geyser, Poland told The Washington Post: “It’s cool, it’s exciting, it’s neat. It’s nothing to be afraid about.”The president of the White House Correspondents’ Association released a statement criticizing dinner headliner Michelle Wolf that has some journalists wondering whether the group actually backs its own press-freedom mission.

As Wolf’s comedy set at Saturday night’s White House Correspondents’ dinner continues to incite condemnation for its unvarnished criticism of Trump administration officials, association president Margaret Talev said in a statement to members that Wolf’s performance was not “unifying” and “not in the spirit” of the group’s mission.

“Last night’s program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honoring civility, great reporting and scholarship winners, not to divide people,” Talev said. “Unfortunately, the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that mission.”President Donald Trump is changing not just American politics. Canadians are increasingly concerned that the president’s nativist and anti-Muslim rhetoric is emboldening hate groups in a Canada, which has long prided itself on multiculturalism and tolerance.

This weekend, far-right activists rallied against asylum seekers on the border between Quebec and New York as riot police and counterprotesters gathered nearby. Members of the Three Percent — a militia founded in the United States that has recently spread to every Canadian province — were at the event. It’s just one of the many far-right groups that have started chapters in the Great White North in the months since Trump’s election.

“After he was elected, obviously the U.S. saw a spike in hate-inspired activity. But Canada did too,” said Ryan Scrivens, a fellow at Concordia University who specializes in tracking far-right groups. He refers to the phenomenon as the “Trump effect.”

“When the U.S sneezes, Canada catches a cold,” he added, repeating the adage.

In Toronto hate crimes went up by almost a third from 2016 to 2017, with Muslims and Jews the primary targets. In Quebec City, reported hate crimes last year targeting Muslims doubled the 2016 total.

Two mass killings in the last 18 months have added to Canadians’ fears of violent extremism. Both attacks were highly unusual for a country that has mostly been spared the kind of deadly violence that has become all too familiar in the United States.

Last month, a 25-year-old man drove a truck into a crowd of pedestrians on a busy Toronto street, killing 10 people. A post on the suspect’s Facebook account called for a “rebellion” by incels, or involuntary celibates, who are part of the far-right manosphere and often espouse violent misogynistic rhetoric. The post celebrated Elliot Rodger, an American who killed six people after writing a hate-filled manifesto against women.

In January last year, a man attacked worshippers at a Quebec City mosque, killing six Muslim men. Before the attack, the shooter obsessed over far-right Islamophobia, American mass killers and Trump.

Trump’s rhetoric has “galvanized Canadian-based white supremacist ideologies, identities, movements and practices,” Scrivens and three fellow researchers argue in a forthcoming article in the Journal of Hate Studies.

Canada now has as many as 130 active right-wing extremist groups, according to researchers ― about a 30 percent increase since the last assessment in 2015.

Some Canadians are especially worried about the Three Percent, a group whose members often tote assault rifles at American white nationalist rallies. Canada’s stricter gun laws mean members can legally carry only items like baseball bats and tire irons. But, according to reports from Vice and other news outlets, the group conducts paramilitary training in private with guns and tactical gear.

“The fact that there are armed militia groups in Canada right now is anathema. This is not something that we’re accustomed to,” said Barbara Perry, an expert on the Canadian far right at the at University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

“It’s just terrifying what the potential consequences are,” she said.

Representatives for Canada’s largest law enforcement and intelligence services refused to comment on how they are addressing any threats posed by the Three Percent and other far-right groups.

It’s not just American hate groups that have made inroads in Canada. Germany’s PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West) has a Canadian chapter whose members have violently clashed with counterprotesters. Soldiers of Odin, originally a Finnish group with ties to neo-Nazis, is also active in Canada and carries out foot patrols in immigrant neighborhoods.

Establishing what exactly has led to the far right’s growth is difficult. Although some say Trump’s rhetoric has fueled Canada’s hate groups, Canadian extremists have long borrowed far-right narratives from Europe and the United States.

Justin Bourque, who killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in a shooting attack in 2014, spread anti-government Three Percent memes and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on social media. He embraced American gun culture and kept a Confederate flag on his bedroom wall.

Canadians also face similar anxieties over immigration and identity that have boosted the far right in other countries.

In Quebec, where some residents fear changing demographics threaten the province’s French-Canadian identity, anti-Islamic and anti-refugee groups flourish. The Montreal Gazette revealed this month that one of North America’s most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal.

Quebec’s largest far-right group is La Meute, or the Wolf Pack, which frequently protests against refugees and immigration. La Meute denies it is Islamophobic, but in private Facebook messages, its leadership has discussed using pig heads to vandalize mosques and intimidate Muslims.

Canada has become a hub for far-right media, and several Canadians are “alt-right” darlings. The country’s Rebel Media has provided a launchpad for white nationalist, anti-Islam activists and bloggers who espouse hate and conspiracy theories.

Canada has its own ecosystem of podcasts, forums and Facebook groups that rail against Muslims, feminists and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s liberal government.

At times these Canadian “alt-right” communities veer into self-parody. A post on one subreddit accused the makers of a bottle of maple syrup of “virtue signaling” because it was certified as a halal product. Another meme calls for making Ontario great again.

“The number of far-right voices is increasing,” said Leila Nasr, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “They’ve become disproportionately loud.”

Community groups and anti-hate advocates want authorities to take a stronger stand against the far right and for politicians to forcefully call out the groups that are attempting to put a polite, Canadian face on bigotry.Disney Night on “American Idol” Sunday did not provide a happily-ever-after for drag queen Ada Vox.

The singer slayed a rendition of “Circle of Life” from “The Lion King” ― but was eliminated.

Vox did not earn enough votes as viewers whittled the top 10 contestants to seven. The performer was the first drag queen to even advance this far in the competition.

“Although America might not be ready for people like those of us who are a little bit different,” Vox told HuffPost in advance of Sunday’s show, “I think it’s very important that our talents be recognized.”

Vox, aka Adam Sanders of San Antonio, Texas, fell short in the popular vote during the previous round, but was advanced by judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie. This time voters had complete say.

Some “Idol” fans were ticked.

The talk show host and the comedian have been slinging mud at each other over the past year, ever since Cohen pulled an “I don’t know her” when asked about him replacing Griffin on CNN’s New Year’s Eve special.

“You know what? I’ve kind of moved on,” Cohen told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Monday. “She seems to hate my guts very strongly. And you know what, that’s her prerogative. Everybody can have someone they hate. If I’m that person for her, so be it.”

Griffin has yet to respond to Cohen’s “white flag,” as the outlet calls it, and has been touring the country with her stand-up show.

The comedian promptly retaliated after Cohen’s initial comments, labeling him “deeply misogynistic.” She went on to post a 17-minute video in which she accused him of offering her cocaine before a taping of his late-night show and mistreating his female employees.

Cohen said he was “completely stunned” by Griffin’s allegations and denied her account of their relationship.

I am completely stunned by this story. It is 100% false and totally made up. — Andy Cohen (@Andy) October 28, 2017

Griffin later added insult to injury when she shared a damaging letter from a man who claimed to be Cohen’s former lover.

“Prepare yourself for some of his transparent retaliation,” she wrote alongside the note. “Do you know me now “b*tch?”

Griffin and Cohen collaborated for years on the Bravo network before their feud. Griffin starred in her own reality show “My Life on the D-List,” produced by Cohen for six seasons, and appeared on his talk show “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” a handful of times, most recently in 2013.

One thing the two do have in common is their distaste for President Donald Trump. Griffin’s firing from CNN’s New Year’s Eve show, after all, was based on her infamous photo shoot with a bloody replica of Trump’s head. Cohen also is an outspoken critic of Trump’s administration, but admitted he would still like to have the president as a guest on his show.

“He’s the president!” Cohen told The Hollywood Reporter. “I would ask him everything. I mean, it would be amazing.”

But he doesn’t think first lady Melania Trump would cut it on “Real Housewives of New York,” should she ever make the jump back to reality TV.Students from Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C., hold up signs on March 14 that have the names of the victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Joshua Roberts / Reuters

The school shooting that took place in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year launched a new generation of gun control activists, inspired walkouts and marches, and sparked the most substantial ― and long-lasting ― shift in public opinion on guns in recent years. The appetite for gun control appears to have tapered off in the following weeks, but some surveys indicate that some changes in public opinion could endure.

HuffPost chart created with Datawrapper

A few changes in thought, however, seem to have stuck.

The percentage of Americans who believe it’s politically possible to pass gun laws has dropped several points since its high in late February, but it’s still higher than it was in the aftermath of last year’s massacres in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas.

In the most recent survey, one-fifth of Americans also chose gun policies as one of the two issues they found most important. That remains a noticeable, if modest, uptick from the 13 percent who chose it as a priority following the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Other polling since the Parkland shooting also suggested gun control was carrying greater-than-usual prominence on the campaign trail, although it’s unclear how much of that energy will remain until November.

That public opinion shifted at all in the wake of the shooting was striking. It’s even more striking that it lasted as long as it did. Last year’s shootings, by contrast, appeared to have little effect on Americans’ views about guns.

One illustration of the uncommon nature of this year’s debate comes from Google Trends, which tracks the level interest in various search terms. According to that data, searches for “mass shooting” usually dwarf searches for “gun control” in the aftermath of an incident, and both disappear soon after. After the Parkland shooting, though, interest in gun control significantly outpaced attention to the shooting itself.

Even now, specific gun reform proposals remain broadly popular.

In the most recent survey, conducted in mid-April, three-quarters of Americans favored strengthening background checks, while just 13 percent opposed the proposal. A 63 percent majority favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21, with only about one-quarter in opposition. And a 42 percent plurality of those polled said President Donald Trump was not doing enough to pass new gun laws, while about one-quarter said he’s doing the right amount. Just 9 percent that he’s doing too much. (At the end of February, 37 percent said Trump wasn’t doing enough.)

Data from other pollsters, meanwhile, suggests that the national focus on guns is waning. But some find that the decline has stopped short of entirely erasing the changes post-Parkland.

Some of the most granular information comes from the progressive pollster Civiqs, which has been tracking data on gun control for several years. According to its data, voters’ backing for such restrictions spiked from the low 50s prior to the Parkland shooting to a high of 60 percent ― a bigger reaction than in the wake of mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs. Some of that change wore off in the weeks after, stabilizing around the 55 percent mark.

Civiqs’ data only goes back through 2015. But support for enacting new gun laws in April was higher than it was after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in 2012, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey, thanks largely to a movement among Democratic-leaning groups. A 53 percent majority of Americans told pollsters they believed student activism on guns were part of a lasting movement, while 43 percent said the rallies were “more of a one-time thing.”

Another poll from Gallup found that the share of Americans mentioning guns or gun control as the nation’s most important problem dropped from 13 percent in March to 6 percent in April ― a downtick that nevertheless leaves it as one of the highest-ranked national issues. In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll, a slim 53 percent majority of Democratic voters said guns will be a major factor for them in November, down 21 points since February.

“This finding raises a cautionary flag for voters who want gun policy to be front and center this election cycle,” Marist polling director Lee Miringoff told NPR.Pop star Katy Perry revealed she’s a fan of Pope Francis during a trip to the Vatican on Saturday.

The singer praised the pontiff for his “compassionate heart and inclusivity” in an Instagram post for her almost 70 million followers.

For her meeting with Francis, Perry brought along actor Orlando Bloom, her on-again, off-again love interest. The pair have reportedly been spotted together a number of times since they announced that they were taking “respectful, loving space” from each other in March 2017.

Perry, the daughter of two evangelical Christian ministers, was at the Vatican on Saturday to speak at a conference on scientific advancements in health care. The three-day Unite to Cure conference is co-hosted by the Pontifical Council for Culture and gathers thought leaders from around the world to discuss the future of medicine.

This isn’t Perry’s first brush with the Roman Catholic Church. Since 2015, the singer has been locked in a legal battle with California nuns who are seeking to block the star’s purchase of their former convent in Los Angeles. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles sold the hilltop mansion to Perry, while the nuns tried to sell their former home to a local California businesswoman. A judge invalidated the nuns’ sale in March 2017 since they did not receive permission from the Vatican, a step that is required by canon law.

The last surviving nun involved in the property dispute, 80-year-old Sister Rita Callanan, told Fox News earlier this month that she is appealing for a meeting with Francis. Callanan hopes the pope will block the sale, saying that Perry’s lifestyle “has strayed far from any faith.”

Below, Katy Perry appears in a video for the Vatican’s Unite To Cure conference with her meditation coach, Bob Roth.

The star was listed as a special guest at the Vatican event over the weekend, alongside an Italian archbishop and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. TV personalities Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Dr. Mehmet C. Oz and Meredith Vieira also spoke at the event.

Perry was invited to speak about how a practice known as Transcendental Meditation has helped her gain control over her anxiety and stress.

“I noticed before I started meditating that I started to short-circuit a little bit,” she said during a presentation with her celebrity meditation teacher Bob Roth. “I knew that I had to take care of my mental health and my mind, which is the greatest asset of my body besides my heart. I knew I had to protect it.”

Perry said the “stillness” she’s found with meditation is “beyond anything I’ve ever experienced.”

“It has helped a lot with my anxiety,” she said. “Instead of having to turn to prescription [drugs], I’ve been able to turn to this.”R. Kelly struck back at the Time’s Up campaign on Monday, saying the group’s efforts are “unjust and off-target” after it called for an investigation into the multiple allegations against the singer of abusing women.

In a statement, a representative for the singer expressed support for the Time’s Up movement while arguing that the accusations against Kelly are unwarranted.

“R. Kelly supports the pro-women goals of the Time’s Up movement. We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals — and in this case, it is unjust and off-target,” the statement reads. “We fully support the rights of women to be empowered to make their own choices. Time’s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly’s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts.”

Kelly’s representative also said it would ultimately “become clear” that the singer is the target of a “greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him.”

“R. Kelly’s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never ― and will never ― be silenced,” the statement said. “Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it.”

Representatives for Kelly did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Some have pointed out that Kelly’s alleged victims are themselves women of color, which seemingly undercuts his argument that he’s being targeted because he is a black man. The statement released by Time’s Up on Monday came from the group’s Women of Color committee, who wrote that they hope to “shine a bright light on our WOC sisters in need.”

“Y’all. This has been a long, hard, fought journey that SO MANY sisters have been on for more than a decade,” Burke wrote Monday on Twitter. “This man is a predator and 100% of his victims have been Black and Brown girls. At times it felt like screaming into a well, but thank God for this reckoning coming.”

On Sunday, Kelly posted a video to his Twitter account where he blamed “rumors” for the recent cancellation of a show he’d been slated to give at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The singer also hinted at possible legal action for the incident.

Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci said over the weekend that fellow director Ridley Scott “should be ashamed” for replacing Kevin Spacey in “All the Money in the World,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Bertolucci also said Scott’s move made him want to cast the disgraced actor, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.

After the allegations surfaced — including actor Anthony Rapp’s claim that Spacey made advances on him when he was 14 — Scott replaced Spacey with Christopher Plummer in reshoots even though the production had wrapped. For his portrayal of J. Paul Getty in the movie, Plummer, 88, became the oldest man to receive an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.

Bertolucci, 77, didn’t applaud the cast change.

Deadline reported that during a screening of his restored 1972 film “Last Tango in Paris” at the Bari International Film Festival in Italy, he said that when he learned of the move, he contacted Scott’s frequent editor Pietro Scalia “to tell Scott that he should be ashamed” for caving to industry pressure.

“And then I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey,” Bertolucci said, according to IndieWire.

At the same time, Bertolucci declared that he fully supports the Me Too movement.

Asked about his remarks, a representative for the 80-year-old Scott, who directed “Thelma & Louise,” emailed, “no comment.”To be a cog in the corporate machine is to subject yourself to injustices large and small in the name of eking out a living: tiresome office politics, a jammed printer, a stolen lunch, or worse, sexual harassment. Just look at the seminal “9 to 5,” “Office Space,” “The Office” and “Corporate,” all pop cultural depictions that draw on the inescapable ennui of zombielike number-crunchers and buttoned-up executive assistants who subsist on burnt coffee and keyboard cleaner, waiting for the day their crappy co-workers and abusive bosses get their due.

Netflix and Sanrio’s new anime series “Aggretsuko,” which debuted on the streaming service on Friday, takes the mundane workplace frustration many of us have come to know and cranks the dial to 11. The series follows Retsuko, an endearing red panda who wants nothing more than to get through her work days without incident. And when real life doesn’t measure up to her hopes, she turns to the only thing that temporarily soothes her discontent: death metal.

Despite all our rage, we have yet to find a coping mechanism better than Aggretsuko's heavy metal habit. Netflix/Sanrio

There’s a lot for Retsuko to get angry about. She works in accounting for some vague corporate entity, one of several lackeys made to tidy the desk of her rage-inducing boss, a literal chauvinist pig. She heads to the office in an overstuffed commuter train, only to have to face a rumor-spreading hippopotamus and a Komodo dragon who loves to dump extra work on her. She faces small, relatable dilemmas outside her job, too: feeling conflicted over how much to give for a wedding present, or simply wanting to shop without constant check-ins from a store clerk.

She gets by thanks to her work buddies — a chill fennec fox with unmatched social-media stalking skills and a hyena in slacks (who, based on Twitter’s consensus, seems to be the most crush-worthy character). She’s in awe of two more experienced colleagues, women who strut down the hallways with an air of #girlboss assuredness, but who actually share many of our titular hero’s insecurities.

Retusko channels all of this insecurity and rage into a death-metal hobby that lets her express exactly how she feels. She tries to hide it first from her more intimidating female co-workers and then from a love interest, but realizes her truest self lies within these moments. It’s in these small vignettes where Retsuko is able to be fully unvarnished: “You’re a shitty boss!” she scream-sings during a work happy hour. “Death metal is my soul!!!” she confesses in another episode.

The sharp contrast between Retsuko’s adorable outward appearance and her unbridled rage-singing is played for laughs in each of the series’ 10 episodes, yet doesn’t become tiresome. Perhaps because it’s rare to see a female character, animated or not, succumb fully to her anger, especially in a way that’s seen as a net positive. Retsuko’s metal habit provides a private, nondestructive space to contend with the pitfalls of an early-career slog.

Requiring a standing appointment at a karaoke bar might be self-care taken to its most extreme, but Retsuko isn’t a role model. She’s just trying to make it through her 20s.

The lyrics of Retsuko’s throat-murdering screams are the cherry atop her rage sundae, adapting to fit her crisis du jour. In one episode, she determines that all she needs is a wealthy partner to escape her current drudgery. Cue the metal guitars, and the passionate cry of future financial security: “MATRIMONIAL FREEDOM!” It’s good.

American audiences might not immediately associate the show with Sanrio, the Japanese company best known for Hello Kitty. Retsuko, along with Sanrio’s listless egg character Gudetama, stand out from the company’s other happily uncomplicated creations by virtue of their issues. Even Retsuko’s resting “cute” face lacks a smile.

The full-length series, inspired by shorts that aired on Japan’s Tokyo Broadcasting System network, hits on an interesting spot. It feels intended for an audience older than do kid-adult crossovers like “Adventure Time” or “Steven Universe.” Yet its lightness — despite all its rage — doesn’t feel quite in line with the darker adult-cartoon stalwart (and fellow Netflix original) “BoJack Horseman.” Still, it’s pointed enough to feel true to life, even if heavy metal isn’t your genre.

The series is generally self-aware, of the moment and endearingly weird: Retsuko’s fennec fox friend, for example, details a pattern in their co-worker’s Instagram feed, nailing down her routine of food, selfie and occasional “thigh shot” pictures. But the office caricatures aren’t always charitable. That same ’gram-friendly co-worker, a starry-eyed doe who talks in a baby voice, also allows the gross boss to flirt with her to her benefit. She’s clearly set up as a contrast to Retsuko and company — surely they’d never stoop so low — but her overly ditzy depiction feels a little one-note at first.

Each episode is a short 15 minutes, putting “Aggretsuko” in the ranks of Netflix’s other feel-good original fare that requires minimal time commitment (looking at you, “Nailed It”). The effect of catching a handful in one sitting is like having read several culturally savvy comic strips: bright colors, enough for a laugh, but not a lot of narrative depth. Fortunately, “Aggretsuko” isn’t trying for prestige television; it succeeds as a cathartic mirror to contemporary office life — and the activities that sustain us once we’ve punched out.

JI SUB JEONG/HPItaly’s President Sergio Mattarella approved the country’s far-right and anti-establishment parties’ nominee for prime minister on Wednesday, putting the nation on track to have one of the most populist and radical administrations in all of Europe.

The far-right Lega and anti-establishment Five Star parties chose law professor Giuseppe Conte as their consensus pick for Italy’s next prime minister, despite his lack of governing experience. Mattarella giving Conte a mandate to form Italy’s next government clears one of the final hurdles for the two parties before they can begin to run the country.

Both Lega and Five Star hold anti-migrant, anti-European Union views and look to bring the country closer to Russia through lifting economic sanctions against the Kremlin. The new populist government sets Italy up for a clash with the EU and brings more uncertainty for the country’s already fractured politics.

The two non-traditional parties decided to band together after Italy’s election in March left no outright winner and resulted in months of negotiations to form a governing coalition. Italians rejected the country’s once-powerful establishment parties in the vote, leaving Lega and Five Star to fill the void.

“The traditional Italian party system disappeared many elections ago,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College. “What you’re seeing now is the detritus of that ― which is a mess.”

A Lega and Five Star coalition was widely seen as a worst case scenario for the EU after Italy’s vote, as both parties hold a longstanding opposition to the bloc. HuffPost Italia obtained an early draft of the coalition’s governing contract in which the two parties hoped to renegotiate EU treaties and identify ways they could potentially opt out of the euro.

The documents showed Five Star and Lega also wanted to reduce Italy’s commitment to NATO, end compulsory vaccinations and ask for the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt.

The parties amended the contract and watered down their stance toward the European Union in subsequent drafts, but the leaked contract was enough to cause Italy’s stock market to plunge and bring speculation that Italy could cause a crisis in the eurozone.

“Even if the more extreme promises or aspirations of leaving the euro don’t materialize, having this kind of government in a major European country is going to inject instability,” Berman said.

Although the parties have moderated their opposition to the EU in recent years, critics are concerned that the new government’s radical social and economic policies will turn Italy into the latest “sick man of Europe.”

Five Star and Lega have vowed sweeping changes to Italy’s economy, the third-largest in the eurozone. The two parties promised to restore higher pension levels, cut taxes and bolster the welfare system ― despite the fact that Italy has the highest debt ratio out of anywhere in Europe except for Greece.

During the campaign, Lega leader Matteo Salvini also said he would deport 150,000 migrants within a year, and he accused immigrants of bringing crime and disease into Italy. Over 600,000 migrants entered Italy in the last four years, sparking a divisive debate over immigration and a swell of support for the far-right.

Salvini has said he wants to close mosques, and critics say his rhetoric has emboldened far-right hate groups within the country, stirring dark memories of political violence in Italy’s past.

To break the deadlock that followed Italy’s election, Salvini decided to abandon his party’s alliance with longtime Italian power broker Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party. Instead, he aligned with the populist, ideologically amorphous Five Star.

Five Star, less than a decade old was the party that won the highest percentage of Italy’s vote. The party is led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, a university dropout who was living at home until five years ago. He took over leadership in 2017, offering voters a fresh face and vowing to fight government corruption.

Although Five Star gained more votes in the election, Di Maio and Salvini agreed that neither would be Italy’s next prime minister. Instead, the parties chose law professor Conte as a consensus candidate. Conte, a 54-year-old who specializes in administrative law was until now not anywhere close to a household name.

Within hours of Conte’s nomination, media and lawmakers began to scrutinize his academic credentials. Although he claimed to have studied at New York University, the institution told The New York Times that they had no record of him either as a student or a faculty member.

But Salvini and Di Maio stood by Conte, and President Mattarella backed the nomination on Wednesday.

Several other far-right and populist parties have joined coalition governments in Europe in recent years, including Austria last December. But unlike in Italy, most have been tethered to establishment parties that have limited their ability to carry out their more extreme policies.To think there was actually a time when Miley Cyrus made the world collectively pearl-clutch with a nude photo.

The year was 2008 and, yes, it did happen. The “Hannah Montana” star, who was 15 years old at the time, famously posed for a Vanity Fair portrait shot by renowned photographer Annie Leibowitz wearing nothing but a satin bedsheet. The photo shoot incited a media outrage that culminated with Cyrus apologizing for disappointing her fans.

Guess what? She’s not sorry anymore. The singer threw it back to simpler times on Sunday night, sharing a photo of a New York Post front page circa 2008 with the headline “MILEY’S SHAME.”

“IM NOT SORRY,” she wrote alongside the photo. “Fuck YOU # 10yearsago.”

IM NOT SORRY



Fuck YOU #10yearsago pic.twitter.com/YTJmPHKwLX — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) April 29, 2018

Back then, in the Vanity Fair profile accompanying the photos, Cyrus actually addressed the potential for blowback, explaining that neither she nor Disney was worried about the shoot.

“No, I mean I had a big blanket on,” she was quoted as saying. “And I thought, ‘This looks pretty, and really natural.’ I think it’s really artsy. It wasn’t in a skanky way.”

The tunes changed quickly, however, and both the singer and the network gave statements disparaging the magazine and positioning Cyrus as a victim of circumstance.

“Unfortunately, as the article suggests, a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines,” a Disney spokesperson said.

“I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be ‘artistic,’ and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed,” Cyrus added in her own statement. “I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.”

In the years that followed, Cyrus shed her Disney image entirely and embraced her sexuality. She released “Party In The U.S.A” in 2009 ― sparking a fresh round of controversy with a pole-dancing performance ― and soon enough she was dancing with a foam finger at the 2013 MTV VMAs and swinging on a wrecking ball sans clothing as unapologetically herself.

She still seems to have a soft spot for her child star days, however, going on a throwback spree over the weekend and sharing some old photos with some very Miley captions.

Seth Rogen is finally weighing in on those sexual misconduct allegations against his longtime friend James Franco.

Rogen recently sat down with Vulture to discuss his upcoming Netflix special “Hilarity For Charity,” his likable stoner persona and his work on “The Disaster Artist,” which Franco directed.

When Vulture’s David Marchese asked Rogen about five women’s accusations of sexual misconduct against Franco, the actor responded somewhat hesitantly.

“The truth is that my perspective on this is the least relevant perspective. I’m friends with these people and I’m a dude,” Rogen said. “All that combined makes me the last person who should be talking about this.”

Rogen added that the allegations do not change his willingness to work with Franco in the future.

In an explosive Los Angeles Times article in January, four actresses and one filmmaker said Franco asked them to perform sexually inappropriate and coercive scenes during a class he taught. According to the report, the women described Franco “storming off” a movie set when they refused his demands to appear naked.

Franco said the allegations were “not accurate,” but that he supports “people coming out and being able to have a voice.” His film “The Disaster Artist” won best actor awards at both the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, and was nominated for an Oscar.

Rogen said he’s very aware of being a white man in an industry that lacks diversity and has a real issue with sexism and sexual harassment. That awareness, he said, definitely influences his work.

“This is not in any way about pandering, but I think ‘Neighbors 2’ had an incredibly progressive message. I think ‘Blockers’ has an incredibly progressive message. We hired Kay Cannon to direct it and she did an amazing job,” Rogen said. “We’re hyperaware of trying to be as representative as possible in the directors and writers and actors we work with. I’m sure we could definitely be doing more to be ahead of the curve in that way, but, again, I couldn’t be more aware that my perspective is not one people are clamoring for.”Hillary Clinton agreed to give the Democratic National Committee her campaign email list, analytics, donor data and other items for $1.65 million.

Several Democratic officials are asking Hillary Clinton to return the money that the Democratic National Committee paid her political group for her campaign email list and other resources.

In February 2017, the DNC agreed to pay Clinton’s group Onward Together $1.65 million for her campaign email list, analytics, donor data and related items, The Intercept reported on Wednesday. The cache of material was worth more than $5 million; Clinton’s campaign made an in-kind donation of resources worth $3.5 million, and the DNC paid for the rest.

Now a number of Democratic Party officials, including some state party chairs and DNC members, want Clinton to retroactively donate the campaign materials to the DNC and return the money that the party organ gave Onward Together.

“She should return the money for the ‘love of the Democratic Party’ to the DNC for its use,” said Alabama Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy Worley, who supported Clinton during the 2016 primary.

Wisconsin Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning and Missouri Democratic National Committeeman Curtis Wylde likewise called on her to retroactively donate it and return the payment.

And Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 primary, argued that Clinton could also contribute the equivalent money to state Democratic parties.

Other DNC officials, including at-large member Brian Wahby and Kansas Democratic National Committeeman Chris Reeves, welcomed an in-kind donation but stopped short of asking for it.

“It would be a Christian thing to do,” Wahby said.

Sanders’ office did not return a request for comment on whether the senator agrees.

“It would be a Christian thing to do.” - Brian Wahby, DNC at-large member

Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended the price tag on Thursday on the grounds that the DNC has already reaped far more than it paid for the email list in fundraising so far.

“Paying a rental fee for use of an email list is common practice, and in this case the DNC has raised over $30 million with it, an 1,800 [percent] return on their investment,” Merrill wrote in an email to Fox News. (The DNC purchased the email list to own, rather than renting its information.)

Merrill did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on calls to retroactively make the resources an in-kind contribution and return the money already received.

Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman, agreed that the DNC had gotten “a return on our investment and more since obtaining all of the lists and data.”

Donna Brazile forged the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC in February 2017, while she was serving as interim DNC chairwoman. Brazile, who has been critical of how the Clinton campaign treated the DNC, said she believed the deal would help her successor as DNC chair “inherit a party in good shape.”

“I felt that it was a fair bargain at the time,” she said.

The current DNC chairman, Tom Perez, has amended the payment schedule, but the core of the accord ― how much the DNC would pay and what it would get in return ― remains in place, according to Hinojosa.

The DNC paid Onward Together $300,000 in January and $135,000 in every subsequent month, according to Federal Election Commission filings and information provided by the DNC. Thus far, it has transferred $705,000 to Clinton’s group; as of the end of this month, that sum will have increased to $840,000.

The revelation of the sale of Clinton campaign resources to the DNC has struck a nerve with some Democratic officials because it exemplifies practices that they have criticized for years.

These Democrats lament the transactional relationship of Democratic standard-bearers with the DNC and state parties, which often have a harder time fundraising. Former President Barack Obama withheld his campaign email list entirely from the DNC during his first term, using it instead to build his political group, Organizing for America (later renamed Organizing for Action). After Obama’s re-election in 2012, he initially allowed the DNC to use the list free of charge before formally donating it to the party body in 2015.

Officials from state parties who joined the Clinton campaign’s joint fundraising agreement during the 2016 election also complained that the campaign left state parties little funding to maintain their operations.

Onward Together, which as a 501(c)(4) political nonprofit is not required to disclose its financial data, says it has distributed grants to 11 progressive groups, including Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something and Color of Change.

However, there are many forms of political organizing that state parties, unlike those groups, are uniquely equipped to do. For example, state parties have historically played important roles in recruiting candidates for state and local office; advising and funding those candidates; and registering and turning out voters in down-ballot races.

Another source of tension is what Sanders allies see as a double standard being applied to the Vermont senator’s famously successful campaign email list. Although Sanders was not the Democratic presidential nominee, after the campaign, many Democrats called on Sanders to turn over his list to the DNC. (Sanders has declined to do so.)

“They weren’t saying Bernie, ‘Rent your list.’ They wanted the list,” said Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the DNC’s Unity and Reform Commission. “They said, ‘All candidates do this ― they turn it over to the party.’ Well, now I find out that they don’t.”

Zogby, who refused to comment on the conduct of the Clinton campaign, was one of several reformers who pressed the Unity Commission to recommend the creation of a financial oversight committee at the DNC with full access to the party’s budget data.

He hopes that the latest revelation will increase support among the DNC’s membership to approve the oversight committee and other financial transparency measures. The entire DNC membership is due to vote on the proposals in August.An emotional Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) hugged son-in-law Ben Domenech and told him to “take care” of his daughter Meghan, The Arizona Republic reported.

“John hugged me tonight,” conservative writer Domenech said Saturday night in a tweet that he later deleted, according to the newspaper. “He asked me to take care of Meghan. I said I would.”

Domenech, founder and publisher of The Federalist, also lashed out in the tweet, apparently at critics of the senator, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last July. “F―k you soulless crazies,” Domenech wrote. “F―k you all the way to hell.”

The six-term senator was released earlier this month from the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix following surgery for an intestinal infection.

He is currently at his home near Sedona, his wife, Cindy, said in a tweet last Monday.

Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC’s “The View,” said in a tweet earlier this month that she was traveling home to see her parents. She said on “The View” that she planned to fly back and forth from New York for a time. “So just know if I’m not here, I’m hanging out with my dad and my mom,” she said.

She thanked people for their “kind words and prayers” for her dad, adding: “It really means so much for my family.”

Such a compelling few days on @TheView! I've really enjoyed it. I am going home to Arizona today to be with my family for the rest of the week but will return Monday.

She recently posted a photo on Instagram, apparently from her wedding, with her dad. “Thank you for teaching me how to be a Viking warrior — even when some thought it more appropriate for boys,” she wrote.

The maverick senator, who ran on the GOP ticket for president against Barack Obama in 2008, has been one of the few Republicans to speak out against Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump took shots at McCain for being captured in North Vietnam and held as a prisoner of war for five years. “He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” Trump received four student deferments from military service between 1964 and 1968.

Last October, McCain slammed Trump policies and his supporters over the Mexican border wall and “crackpot conspiracy theories.” It’s “time to wake up,” McCain said in a speech at the Naval Academy. “I believe in America. We’re capable of better. We’re hopeful, compassionate people.”

I believe in Americans and the American dream, but it’s time we wake up. pic.twitter.com/QmSIqP0TEs — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) October 30, 2017

He has said that attacking freedom of the press is “how dictators get started,” and lashed Trump in March for congratulating Vladimir Putin for winning a “sham election.”

Last month, McCain said Trump’s very public announcement that he was pulling U.S. troops out of Syria “emboldened” president Bashar Assad just days before Assad was accused of launching a chemical attack on his people.

McCain voted against his party’s bill to repeal and replace Obamacare last summer.Former Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore filed a complaint on Monday claiming he was the target of a political conspiracy ahead of the Alabama special election in December.

Moore, a former judge, lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a special election to fill a Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones defeated Moore by about 20,000 votes ― or 1.5 percentage points.

Controversy swirled around Moore in the final months of the campaign as several women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct, including allegations that he pursued and harassed teenage girls when he was in his 30s and sexually assaulted one. Moore has denied the allegations.

In his complaint, filed in civil court in Etowah County, Alabama, Moore claims that his accusers shared a “common design” and planned their allegations to undermine his campaign. The complaint names four of Moore’s accusers ― Leigh Corfman, Debbie Wesson Gibson, Beverly Young Nelson and Tina Johnson ― as well as Richard Hagedorn, a reported friend of Corfman’s.

In a statement released on a campaign Facebook page, Moore’s attorney, Melissa Isaak, said the allegations against Moore “arose from a political conspiracy to destroy his personal reputation and defeat him in the special Senate election for United States Senate.”

Moore “has filed this action not only to hold accountable those who are guilty of slanderous and libelous conduct, but also to restore his good name, character, and reputation with the people of Alabama,” Isaak said.

Monday’s complaint claims the women’s allegations arose “coincidentally” roughly a month before the election and that Moore faced “no hint of scandal” in his years in public office prior to that.

Moore was twice elected chief justice of Alabama and twice removed from court for violations. In 2003, a judicial ethics panel removed Moore from office for failing to comply with an order to take a Ten Commandments monument out of the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery. He was re-elected, but was removed from the court again in September 2016 for defying federal orders on same-sex marriage. The former judge has said he believes “homosexual conduct should be illegal.”

The complaint also reiterates the claim that Corfman, whose allegations were first published in The Washington Post, was paid for coming forward with her story ― an accusation she denies.

Corfman filed a lawsuit against Moore in January, saying he made defamatory remarks against her after she alleged that he touched her sexually in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32. Moore, in turn, sued Corfman for defamation in April.

Monday’s suit accuses the defendants on seven counts, including civil conspiracy, and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages.

Neil Roman, an attorney for Corfman, said in a statement to the Alabama Media Group that Moore’s latest claims “have no more merit than those he has made before.”

Gonzalez, the March for Our Lives speaker who has spearheaded a renewed cry for gun control after a massacre left 17 dead at her Florida high school in February, did not directly respond to West.

Instead, she wrote “my hero” on a tweet similar to West’s, only Gonzalez named James Shaw Jr. It was Shaw who tackled and disarmed Waffle House mass shooting suspect Travis Reinking while he was reloading his weapon in an April 22 attack in Tennessee, preventing further bloodshed.

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper and Offset, her fiancee and member of the band Migos, headlined the music event ― which, yes, is actually called the Broccoli City Festival ― and they apparently spent some downtime backstage with Sasha Obama.

How did this trio get together? We have no idea, but 16-year-old Sasha looks like she’s been part of the gang for ages.

People on Twitter were shook about the hangout, Sasha growing up, and everything in between:
