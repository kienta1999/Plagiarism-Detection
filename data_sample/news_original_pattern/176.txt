Let’s get something out of the way: Selena Gomez is a goddess among us mere mortals and has cornered the market on turning looks time and time again.

That being said, something was a bit off when she walked the red carpet at the Met Gala in New York on Monday wearing a sheer custom-made Coach gown.

Now the dress, which was admittedly more straightforward than some of the night’s outlandish looks (see Katy Perry’s literal angel wings), wasn’t the problem. It was her presumed over-eager spray tan, which fans were quick to roast on social media after Gomez stepped out looking a bit more orange than usual.

Unlike every other person in attendance for the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” exhibit, Gomez had yet to mention the event on Instagram, where she happens to be the most-followed celebrity in the world.

She broke her silence on #TanGate (yeah, that’s what we’re calling it) on Wednesday, seemingly poking fun at her Met Gala mishap.

In the video, Gomez is seen sprinting away from the camera and into the backseat of a van as her dress trails behind her.

“Me when I saw my pictures from MET 🤷🏽‍♀️,” she captioned the post.

Given all that she’s gone through in the past year (a kidney transplant, reuniting with Justin Bieber, being dragged on the daily by her mom) Gomez is nothing if not resilient.

And, hey, if you can’t laugh at yourself, then who can you laugh at? Just kidding, you can always laugh at Bieber.Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, center, has been elected the new prime minister of Armenia. Gleb Garanich / Reuters

YEREVAN (Reuters) - Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was elected as Armenia’s new prime minister on Tuesday, capping a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism in the ex-Soviet republic.

Moscow, which has a military base in Armenia, is wary of an uncontrolled change of power which would pull the country out of its orbit, but Pashinyan has offered assurances that he will not break with the Kremlin.

The election of Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor who spent time in prison for fomenting unrest, marks a rupture with the cadre of rulers who have run Armenia since the late 1990s.

He spearheaded a protest movement that first forced veteran leader Serzh Sarksyan to step down as prime minister and then pressured the ruling party to abandon attempts to block his election as prime minister, the country’s most powerful post.

In a vote in parliament on Tuesday, 59 lawmakers backed Pashinyan’s candidacy, including some from the ruling Republican Party, with 42 voting against.

In a vote last week, the Republican Party blocked Pashinyan, but it said on Tuesday it had decided to get behind him for the sake of unity and the good of the nation.

A central square in the capital, where Pashinyan’s supporters gathered to watch the voting on huge television screens, erupted into joy when the result was shown.

The tens of thousands of people in Republic Square shouted “Nikol!” and white doves were released into the air. People hugged and kissed each other.

“I’m the happiest person in the world,” said Shogik, a 17-year-old Pashinyan supporter.

Armenia is a country of about three million people nestling in mountains between Turkey and Iran.

Pashinyan’s protest movement was sparked when Sarksyan, barred by the constitution from seeking another term as president, became prime minister instead. Many Armenians saw that as a cynical ploy by Sarskyan to extend his hold on power.
