Comedian Michelle Wolf remains totally unbowed by the backlash to her White House Correspondents’ Association dinner set.

So much so that on Wednesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” Wolf threw out some more gags about White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

“It went great, and every single person loved it,” Wolf joked to Meyers about her performance at the April 28 event. “Actually, Sarah Huckabee Sanders called me and she was like, ‘I loved it so much. I got every joke.’”

Meyers feigned surprise, and Wolf, who used to work on “Late Night,” replied with a turn of phrase recently used by Sanders herself: “Well, you know, you give the best information you have at the time.”

Wolf caused controversy at the dinner for saying Sanders “burned facts” to create the “perfect smokey eye.” Critics interpreted the line as an attack on Sanders’ physical appearance, but Wolf later insisted it was solely “about her despicable behavior.”

AdvertisementFans of NBC’s “Chicago P.D.” were on the case after Wednesday’s season finale made a bold move on the fate of Alvin Olinsky, the detective played by Elias Koteas for the past five seasons.

This should put you up to speed:

SPOILER ALERT: Nothing could have prepared us for this. #ChicagoPD pic.twitter.com/Z5PlyRjt2N — Chicago P.D. (@NBCChicagoPD) May 10, 2018

Olinsky’s future was already looking precarious in the previous episode. After landing behind bars on an unjust murder charge, he was stabbed.

Olinsky died early on Wednesday’s finale, giving viewers plenty of time to sound off on social media.

Man! Elias Koteas deserved better. — Ajay Chand (@AjayCnyc) May 10, 2018

No words except thank you #eliaskoteas for one of the most beloved, most original characters ever to hit my screen. @NBCChicagoPD I’m not sure I’ll recover 😭😭😭. #RIPOlinsky #chicagopdfinale pic.twitter.com/V3no99tvQH — Suzan Burruel 🤦🏻‍♀️💆🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ (@suzanmarieb) May 10, 2018

Executive producer Rick Eid explained to Entertainment Weekly why the show killed off good ol’ Al. “From a dramatic point of view, we all thought it was really interesting,” he said.

One Twitter user urged the show to somehow rescind Olinsky’s ascendance to TV detective heaven.

Ok. Enough! Find a way to raise Al from the dead!!! Love #EliasKoteas — Angela Harrison (@Angela_s_harris) May 10, 2018Hopefully they learned their lesson.

On “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Wednesday, folks on the street got a chance to apologize for the dumb stuff they did to their teachers.

The stunt was to celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week and it proved that educators sure do take a lot of crap.Stephen Colbert is reaching for his calculator.

The “Late Show” host ran the numbers amid reports that a company linked to a Russian oligarch allegedly sent payments to a firm controlled by President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen.

Just how many porn stars can you pay off with that kind of dough?
