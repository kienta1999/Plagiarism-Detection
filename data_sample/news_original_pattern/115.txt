“Infinity War” screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus helped to clear up what some fans believe to be inconsistencies with the timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a conversation with Collider published this week.

**WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**

One big question is, when exactly does Thanos retrieve the infinity gauntlet? If Asgard protects the forge that creates the gauntlet, and Asgard isn’t destroyed until 2017′s “Thor: Ragnarok,” then why do we see Thanos with the gauntlet after the credits in 2015′s “Avengers: Age Of Ultron”? Wouldn’t someone have been notified?

“I think the Gauntlet was made when Loki was pretending to be Odin,” Markus told Collider, at about the 38:20 mark in the video above. “Presumably, Eitri was running a relatively regular business and people would come there for things and somebody would have said something.”

In other words, with Loki impersonating Odin after the events of 2013′s “Thor: The Dark World,” and Loki’s motives always being morally ambiguous, we have to assume he looked the other way while Thanos had the gauntlet made.

Fans don’t seem too bothered by the issue, considering that “Infinity War” has grossed more than $600 million domestically, according to Forbes.

That said, we still have some questions of our own. In “Infinity War,” because the handle of Thor’s axe Stormbreaker is made of Groot, why doesn’t the handle disappear when Groot disintegrates at the end?Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City and part of President Donald Trump’s legal team, is coming under fire... from himself.

Comments he made in 1998 during the investigation into President Bill Clinton seem to undermine the arguments he’s making today for Trump.

On Sunday, Giuliani said the president doesn’t have to testify even if subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“We don’t have to,” Giuliani insisted. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.”

But he sang a different tune in an interview with interviewer Charlie Rose two decades ago.

“You gotta do it,” he said. “I’m mean, you don’t have a choice.”

Rose then asked what would happen if the president refused.

Giuliani replied:

“Then there is a procedure for handling that. You go before a judge and a judge decides whether or not he has a recognizable exemption or privilege from testifying. And if a judge decides that he doesn’t, you have to testify. You don’t have a choice about it.”

If the President is subpoenaed to testify, “he’s gotta do it. He has no choice.”

Later in the same interview, Giuliani said the Watergate case that brought down President Richard Nixon “resolved the fact that the president is not above the law, is not able to avoid subpoenas.”

He said the president has the right to go to a judge to see if the proceeding is improper. “And, if a judge agrees with that, fine,” Giuliani said. “But, if a judge doesn’t, then you have to testify.”

Giuliani said that, as far as criminal law is concerned, the president should be treated as a citizen.

The former mayor also torpedoed another argument that’s been used by Trump, that the investigation is hurting the country.
