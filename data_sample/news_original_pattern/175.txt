Actress Geena Davis and husband Reza Jarrahy are divorcing after more than 16 years of marriage, Entertainment Tonight reported.

Jarrahy filed the papers on Tuesday, citing irreconcilable differences and requesting joint legal and physical custody of their teenaged daughter and twin sons, the site noted from court documents. He also asked for spousal support.

According to People, the filing featured the names “Rob Doe vs. Veronica Doe.”

The two separated in mid-November.

The “Thelma & Louise” star and Jarrahy, a plastic surgeon, tied the knot on Sept. 1, 2001. It was Davis’ fourth marriage.

The Oscar-winning actress was previously hitched to director Renny Harlin, actor Jeff Goldblum, and restaurateur Richard Emmolo.Pauley Perrette’s Abby Sciuto said goodbye to “NCIS” on Tuesday and fans couldn’t handle it.

Perrette, who had built up that public affection over 15 seasons as the CBS crime show’s goth genius, had announced her planned departure in October, but that didn’t make the parting any less sorrowful.

But if you want to know what happened to dear Abby, Tuesday’s episode revealed that the forensic scientist has gone to a better place ... charity work! (What did you think we meant?)

After being shot in part one of her farewell arc, Abby awakened from a coma in part two to help solve her own shooting and the murder of Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry) in the same attack.

Abby announced she was escorting Reeves’ body back to London and wouldn’t be returning. “I’m leaving NCIS,” she said, adding that she was going to operate a charity that Reeves had wanted to start as a tribute to his late mother.

She makes the goodbye hug rounds and later signs “I love you” to Gibbs (Mark Harmon).

Twitter needed a hankie. QUICK.

The actor was fired from “Lethal Weapon” as the buddy-cop TV series finished its season on Tuesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

And it wasn’t looking good for his character, Martin Riggs, who was shot in the chest in the just-aired finale, TVLine noted.

Warner Bros. Television producers are attempting to find a replacement for Crawford as Fox prepares for a presentation to ad buyers on Monday, Variety reported, citing unnamed sources.

“You can’t fire me on my day off!” Crawford cried on Twitter.
