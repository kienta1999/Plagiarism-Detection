“It’s a phony document,” Arpaio told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday, claiming to have “evidence” that he document isn’t real, but providing no proof for his allegation.

“We have the evidence, nobody will talk about it, nobody will look at it, and anytime you want to come down or anybody we’ll be glad to show you the evidence,” said Arpaio, who announced his Senate run this week.

It’s hardly the first time the former sheriff ― who was last year convicted of misdemeanor criminal contempt of court for defying an order to stop racially profiling Latinos ― has claimed Obama’s birth certificate is fake. He was one of the loudest voices in the birther movement, which suggests that the country’s first black president was not born in the U.S., and sent a deputy to Hawaii in 2012 to investigate.

The birther hoax first came to light during Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, but was revived in 2011 when conservative public figures, including Trump, talked about it. Obama had already released a short-form birth certificate in 2008, but the scrutiny led him to in April 2011 release a long-form version. Nevertheless, Trump and Arpaio continued to loudly express doubts about its authenticity.

Trump has repeatedly said that he doesn’t regret questioning the legitimacy of Obama’s presidency, even suggesting that he only abandoned the movement to focus on his own presidential run.

“I was the one that got him to put up his birth certificate,” Trump said while campaigning in September 2016. “I’m very proud of it.”

Trump and Arpaio, united by birtherism and their shared hard-line immigration views, solidified their camaraderie in August, when the former sheriff received Trump’s first presidential pardon.In an effort to protect the true creator of a private online list of men in the media who have been accused of sexual misconduct, multiple women are taking credit for it after concerns arose that the author was about to be “outed.”

Dayna Tortorici, editor of n+1 magazine, tweeted Tuesday that she was aware of a possible story in the works at Harper’s Magazine that aimed to name the author of the “Shitty Media Men” list. Tortorici and many other women quickly posted on Twitter advising against “doxxing,” in which a person’s identifying information is revealed online.

“It’s come to my attention that a legacy print magazine is planning to publish a piece ‘outing’ the woman who started the Shitty Media Men list,” Tortorici tweeted Tuesday. “All I can say is: don’t. The risk of doxxing is high. It’s not the right thing to do.”

“Shitty Media Men,” a Google document, began to circulate in a “whisper network” of women after the wave of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein came to light in October. BuzzFeed exposed the list, designed to collect information on accused men, in an article that pushed its creator to take the list down.

Women feared the consequences of naming the author, who seemingly intended the document only as a way for victims in the media industry to collect information in a safe, private manner.

Nicole Cliffe, co-founder of The Toast blog site, offered to pay freelancers to pull articles from Harper’s magazine after sources told her the publication was working on the piece. The Washington Post and The New York Times both reported Wednesday that Katie Roiphe, the writer supposedly behind the story, had no intention of naming anyone in the article.

I'm interrupting my break for one tweet only, so take a screenshot: I created the shitty men in media list. You don't need to doxx me, just head to my Instagram account, it's easy to find out where I hang out if you want to say hi. — Lexi Alexander ‎ (@Lexialex) January 10, 2018

.@harpers needs to know that I am the real author of the #shittymediamen list. If they publish #KatieRoiphe piece asserting another woman is behind it, not only will they ruin an innocent woman's life, but their credibility is shot forever. Best rethink this @gmelucci. https://t.co/8lT9DgS4P8 — Mandy Stadtmiller (@mandystadt) January 10, 2018

Hold up. Mandy @harpers should know that I am the real author of the #shittymediamen list. If they publish #KatieRoiphe piece asserting another woman is behind it, not only will they ruin an innocent woman's life, but their credibility is shot forever.

Mandy, how could you? You know damn well I’m the author of that @Harpers piece. If they credit you, or anyone else, for crafting the #Shittymediamen list Joan of Snarc will see them in court!



Also, Harpers is Shitty Media. — Joan of Snarc 🏹 (@Joan_of_Snarc) January 10, 2018
