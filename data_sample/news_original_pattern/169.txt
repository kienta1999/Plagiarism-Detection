New York gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon took more swipes at incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) this week and even introduced a catchy phrase: “Vote for the homo, not for the Cuomo.”

On Tuesday, Nixon gave her rebuttal to the annual Legislative Correspondents Association dinner in a speech replete with snarky comments and witticisms about Cuomo.

“Cuomo thinks that I should stick to acting, but after seeing Cuomo try to play the part of a progressive, I think he should stick to politics,” said the former “Sex and the City” star.

“His performance has not been very convincing of late. You might say he’s an unqualified thespian,” Nixon added.

Her comment was a nod to former New York City Council speaker and mayoral candidate Christine Quinn’s dismissal of Nixon as an “unqualified lesbian.” Quinn later apologized, but the phrase lives on.

Nixon also dinged Cuomo for appearing to change his stances on climate change, restoring voting rights, banning plastic bags and more since she announced her candidacy.

“It’s called the ‘Cynthia Effect’... Before this campaign is over, he’ll be getting arrested, protesting his own administration,” she quipped.

But none of Nixon’s remarks got as much applause as her “Vote for the homo, not for the Cuomo” line, which has historical precedent. During the 1977 New York City mayoral campaign, when Ed Koch ran against Cuomo’s father, Mario Cuomo, flyers appeared that read, “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.”

In what’s being hailed as a milestone for transgender rights, residents of Ontario, Canada, can now identify as “male,” “female” or “X” on their birth certificates or remove the gender designation altogether.

Ontario-born filmmaker Joshua M. Ferguson was the province’s first known recipient of a non-binary birth certificate last week. Ferguson, who does not identify as a man or a woman and uses the gender-neutral pronouns “they” and “their,” received their birth certificate ― which features an “X” instead of an “M” or “F” ― on May 4.

Ontario’s government said its revised birth certificate policy aims to “recognize and respect all transgender and non-binary people” and “give all Ontarians access to identification that matches their gender identity,” according to ServiceOntario’s website. The province issued its first gender-neutral driver’s licenses and health identification cards last year.

Ferguson hailed the news as “a victory for me and the community” in a Twitter post on Monday.

I've now received my non-binary birth certificate from Ontario! It's a victory for me and the community!

“I am so relieved, because I know this policy will save lives,” they said in an accompanying video, which can be viewed above. “I want trans kids and trans adults to know that you matter. You deserve respect, and you deserve to be officially recognized in Canada.”

Ferguson, 35, initially filed an application for a non-binary birth certificate in May of last year, CBC News reports. Toronto’s ServiceOntario office, however, delayed the request, prompting them to file a complaint with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, arguing that their rights had been violated under the Ontario Human Rights Code.

They expressed their frustrations over the legal battle in a blog post for HuffPost Canada in October, writing, “These delays and denials of our right to correct identification are dangerous for non-binary people and for society as a whole.”

“As non-binary trans people, we will continue to fight and our conviction is strong,” they added, “but we need our governments to stand up, to join us in this fight and to protect us not in the future, but now.”

Ferguson’s victory follows that of transgender activist Gemma Hickey, who was the first Canadian to receive a non-binary birth certificate, in Newfoundland and Labrador in December, according to CBC.
