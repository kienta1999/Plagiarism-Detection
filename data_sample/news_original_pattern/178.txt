An Israeli celebrity chef is accused of stepping out of line after serving Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dessert out of a metal shoe during a formal dinner with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week.

Abe and his wife, Akie Abe, were guests of Netanyahu and his wife, Sara Netanyahu, at their residence when chef Moshe Segev served chocolates in faux footwear.

Many saw the shoes’ use as serving dishes, though perhaps avant-garde, as being in extremely poor taste, since it’s a popular Japanese custom to remove shoes before entering homes, temples and certain restaurants for sanitary reasons.

“There’s no culture in the world in which you put shoes on the table,” Israel’s daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot quoted an unidentified Japanese diplomat as saying, according to a translation by The Washington Post. “What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humor, we don’t think it is funny; we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.”

Yediot Aharonot also quoted an unidentified senior Israeli official as calling the object’s choice “insensitive.”

“There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won’t find shoes in their offices. This is disrespect of the first order,” the paper said.

Segev showcased his work on Instagram, and some commenters branded his use of the ersatz brogues “disgusting” “uneducated” and “ignorant.”

He chose the shoes from British interior design company Tom Dixon Studio, which describes them on its website as cast aluminum and suggests employing them as doorstops.

A spokesperson for Segev defended the dessert in question in an emailed statement to HuffPost on Wednesday.

“The dessert was served inside a sculpture by international artist Tom Dixon, whose works are displayed in major museums around the world and for the first time was displayed in Israel at a meal,” the statement said. “The two prime ministers and their wives were very enthusiastic about the meal and the dessert in particular, applauded and cheered the chef. The Japanese prime minister even went so far as to invite the chef to cook in Japan.”

Segev is known to give an artistic flair to his culinary work.

A year ago, he created edible chesspieces as part of the dessert for the Netanyahus, President Donald Trump and Melania Trump during a formal dinner. Those pieces were served on plates that featured the two leaders’ silhouettes.

Whether Segev knew about the taboo involving shoes at a dinner table is not known. His restaurant did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday vowed to stay in the Iran nuclear deal shortly after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the multinational pact, a decision that ignited outcry and concern from fellow world leaders.

Rouhani, in a blistering televised address, criticized the U.S. as a country that “never adheres to its commitments” and accused its people of having “always adopted a hostile approach.”

“By exiting the deal, America has officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty,” he said.

Rouhani said his country will continue to work with other nations that are part of the agreement, though it will resume its nuclear activities if the deal’s goals are not met.

“If we achieve the deal’s goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place,” he said.

Iranian state television also called Trump’s decision to withdraw “illegal, illegitimate and undermines international agreements,” Reuters reported.

Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said his country will continue its trade with Iran and not answer to anyone else on the matter.

“From now on, we will carry out our trade with Iran, within the possible framework, until the end, and we will not give account to anyone for this,” Zeybekci said in an interview with broadcaster CNN Turk.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long opposed the deal, appeared to be one of the few international leaders to immediately applaud Trump’s decision. In a short televised address on Tuesday, he said the deal with Iran was “a disaster for our region, a disaster for the peace of the world.”

Key players in the race to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons have meanwhile reacted with alarm and concern to Trump’s announcement.

British Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron released a joint statement that expressed disappointment in Trump’s decision to withdraw from the agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.

“Together, we emphasise our continuing commitment to the JCPoA. This agreement remains important for our shared security,” the statement read.

“According to the [International Atomic Energy Agency],” an agency that has monitored and verified Iran’s nuclear-related commitments, “Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out by the JCPoA, in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world is a safer place as a result,” the statement continued.

“The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake,” he said, adding that France will work on a broader agreement to cover Iran’s nuclear activity, ballistics program and regional activities.

Former President Barack Obama and Former Secretary of State John Kerry also chimed in, with Obama defending the JCPOA as a pact that was “working.”

“The JCPOA is in America’s interest ― it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. And the JCPOA is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish ― its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea,” the former president’s statement said. “Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes ― with Iran ― the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans.”

Kerry also lamented Trump’s decision in his own statement, saying it “weakens our security, breaks America’s word, isolates us from our European allies, puts Israel at greater risk, empowers Iran’s hardliners, and reduces our global leverage to address Tehran’s misbehavior, while damaging the ability of future Administrations to make international agreements.”

Macron and his fellow European co-signatories had taken turns trying to convince Trump to remain committed to the deal. In addition to reports of diplomatic wrangling between Europe and the U.S. over the past few weeks, U.K. foreign secretary Boris Johnson traveled to the U.S. Monday, hammering home his position in a media blitz.

Johnson insisted in an op-ed for The New York Times that leaders could work on the deal’s flaws. On the president’s morning cable news show of choice, “Fox & Friends,” Johnson urged Trump not to “throw the baby out with the bathwater.” He then told Sky News that Trump would be worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize if he could fix the deal.

Johnson expressed his upset over Trump’s decision on Tuesday but affirmed that the “U.K. remains strongly committed to the JCPOA.”

Both Merkel and Macron also traveled to Washington in recent weeks to have similar conversations with Trump.

Macron said France doesn’t plan to leave the agreement but is happy to work with Trump in crafting a new, more comprehensive deal that addresses some of the issues that both countries feel were left out of the current version. French officials made it even more clear that they’re committed to the existing deal in the lead-up to Trump’s announcement.

“We are determined to save this deal because this accord safeguards against nuclear proliferation and is the right way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Monday.

Netanyahu pulled out the big guns last week in his push to get Trump to scrap it altogether.

“Iran lied, big time,” he said in a speech delivered in English.

Iran has made clear that it has no intention of renegotiating or forging a new deal.
