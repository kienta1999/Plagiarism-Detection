Allergy sufferers, be warned.

Just watching this video may make you sneeze.

Eric Henderson sent a gigantic cloud of pollen into the air after tapping a tree trunk with his backhoe in Millville, New Jersey.

“When my husband said the pollen’s bad, I probably should’ve taken his word for it,” Henderson’s wife, Jennifer, wrote on Facebook Monday. “Crazy!”

The above clip has now gone viral, with more than 4.7 million views.

The video also was shared on Twitter by The Weather Channel meteorologist Mike Seidel, who called it a “pollen bomb.”

Seidel’s post prompted many people to make the same point in reply:

But the “World of Dance” judge faced a tough challenge on “The Tonight Show” Wednesday.

She and host Jimmy Fallon competed to see who could dance fast to the “least danceable” slow songs of the ’70s, like “Three Times A Lady” by the Commodores.

Lopez was definitely game.Yale Police responded to a call in the early hours of Tuesday, May 8 at 1:40 a.m. The caller reported that she was a student at the Hall of Graduate Studies (HGS) and said that there was a woman sleeping in the common room on the 12 floor, and that she did not know who the person was. Three police officers responded to HGS around 1:45 a.m., where the caller met them at the entrance and showed them her ID. She then let them up in the elevator, which stopped at the fifth floor where another student appeared.

At this point, the caller pointed to the other student and said, “This is her.” Protocol is for police to separate the parties involved, so two officers stayed with the woman on the fifth floor and the investigating officer went with the caller to the 12th floor.

The investigating officer spent over 11 minutes initially with the caller to assess the situation, while the other two officers spent about 15 minutes with the other woman to assess the situation and to confirm her identity. After reviewing the scene in the 12 floor common room and seeing a computer, books, and notebooks in addition to a blanket and pillow on the couch, the investigating officer determined that the person who had been sleeping in the common room was likely a student, so the officer asked the caller to wait in her room on the 12 floor.

The investigating officer reported what she found to the other two officers on the fifth floor and to a supervisor who had arrived to assess the situation and determine whether assistance was needed. The officers were having a difficult time confirming the other student’s identification due to the use of the student’s preferred name in the system that was different from the official name on the ID. The supervisor worked with dispatch and security to clear up the matter, taking down the student’s information and giving her a case number. The assessment of the ID took about 15 minutes, which is longer than usual.

At that point, the investigating officer, with her supervisor, went to the 12 floor, where they spoke to the caller again for another seven minutes. Another officer also followed. They informed the caller that the student who had been in the common room was an authorized resident who had every right to be there. They also explained that this was not a police matter and were reporting the incident to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Officers left HGS Studies at about 2:34 a.m.
