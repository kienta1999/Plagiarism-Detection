As the model and daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin attempted to navigate the red carpet in her stunning Tommy Hilfiger gown, Mendes was caught on camera making sure that the fabric of her train fell just right.

The “Stitches” singer took precautions not to step on her dress as well.

And if all that weren’t sweet enough, Mendes, 19, walked backward up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in order to help Baldwin, 21, navigate the stairs.

According to People, the couple — who made their red carpet debut Monday night — have been romantically linked since late 2017.

Although neither celebrity’s camp has officially confirmed their relationship as of yet, both posted photos from the event in which they looked pretty cozy with one another.

A+ train game, guys! Eduardo Munoz / ReutersSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is apologizing for comments he made on Monday that Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) reported request to have Donald Trump stay away from his funeral is “ridiculous.”

Hatch pointed out that Trump is not only the president of the United States but also “a very good man.”

McCain, 81, was diagnosed with brain cancer last July and has been discussing his final plans, including his funeral. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have been asked to do eulogies, and Hatch suggested the 45th president should also give one.

“He would be a very interesting speaker and would do a good job for John,” Hatch told CNN.

Hatch changed his tune on Tuesday after McCain’s daughter, Meghan, called him out on ABC’s “The View.”

“I’d like everybody to take a collective breath and chill out on my dad for a second — especially Orrin Hatch,” she said on the show.

When Hatch heard this, he realized the error of his ways.

“I felt badly. I had spoken out of turn,” the Utah Republican told reporters, according to CNN. “I felt like I shouldn’t have said what I said.”

Hatch also sent a letter to McCain apologizing for butting in regarding the funeral plans and for suggesting that McCain would not return to the Senate, according to The Washington Post.
