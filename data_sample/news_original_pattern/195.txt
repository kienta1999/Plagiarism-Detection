WASHINGTON ― The Senate judiciary committee voted Thursday to advance U.S. District Court nominee Wendy Vitter, a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn’t tell senators about her past extreme comments on the topic.

Every Republican on the committee voted for Vitter, a New Orleans lawyer and President Donald Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Those GOPers were Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).

Every Democrat voted against Vitter.

During her April confirmation hearing, Vitter, 57, repeatedly avoided saying whether she still agrees with a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.

“Planned Parenthood says they promote women’s health,” she said at the time, per New Orleans’ Clarion Herald. “It is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women’s health is to let them live.”

Many of Trump’s court picks have records of being anti-abortion. Vitter, who is general counsel of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is married to former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), has been pretty upfront about her background, too.

But her refusal to say whether she stands by her past comments didn’t sit well with Democrats on the committee. It didn’t help that she failed to disclose that speech to the panel, along with other speeches she’s given.

Vitter also didn’t tell senators that she moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion ― or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms saying that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News uncovered these missing materials in March.

Omitting details like this is a big no-no to senators on the committee, who expect a thorough submission of background materials for judicial nominees. It also at least creates the appearance of Vitter not wanting the panel to know about some of her controversial comments.

“All I’m looking for are judges that are fair and impartial,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said in Thursday’s hearing. “They need to exhibit judgment, not to mention common sense. Ms. Vitter’s public endorsement of these obvious falsehoods... and her urging of the audience to distribute materials containing such obvious lies shows she lacks the judgment for a lifetime appointment.”

Vitter has also taken heat for not saying if she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.

Her nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.First lady Melania Trump unveiled her “Be Best” campaign on Monday to encourage “positive social, emotional and physical habits” in children.

According to the Be Best website, one key facet of the initiative is to help children “avoid negative social media interaction.”

“They must choose their words wisely and speak with respect and compassion,” the site noted.

That message was in line with the first lady’s previous comments about wanting to combat bullying online. But it also left some wondering if “Be Best” should apply to President Donald Trump, who often uses Twitter to belittle critics and rivals:

Social media is too often used in negative ways and that it is important for children to learn positive online behaviors at a young age. - Melania Trump

Melaina’s new campaign to help kids not bully each other online called Be Best is going to be awesome with the help of some top advisors like Pocahontas, Nasty Woman, Pig, Lil’ Corker, Sloppy Steve, Slime Ball Comey, Crazy Maxine Waters, and Sleepy Eyes. — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) May 7, 2018

I join First Lady @MelaniaTrump in opposing bullying in all forms and think "Be Best" is a great idea for a campaign. Perhaps it can launch with this video at https://t.co/HVXX6bAy0Z? pic.twitter.com/8Ds5GKWYVo — Karl Frisch (@KarlFrisch) May 7, 2018

I don’t want my children to be best, I want them to be good. — Scott Derrickson (@scottderrickson) May 7, 2018

Dear @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP,



I'm still waiting on your response to the bullying perpetrated by your husband @realDonaldTrump and his supporters.



That would be a way to really help our children #BeBesthttps://t.co/J3oDfmMvNv — John Pavlovitz (@johnpavlovitz) May 7, 2018

Here's Melania practicing for her anti-bullying campaign #BeBest by demanding to know why Obama won't show "the American people" his birth certificate. Or something. https://t.co/XTdTNkOJMT — Steve Silberman (@stevesilberman) May 7, 2018

"Be Best."

Maybe look over your shoulder, Melania.

With all due respect, Melania might want to clean up her own house & bullying husband before she talks to the nation abt social & emotional health #BeBest — Rabbi Jill Zimmerman (@RabbiJill) May 7, 2018

Hypocrisy = gloating about the resignation of Eric Schneiderman while continuing to support Donald Trump.



Irony = Melania Trump's anti-cyber bullying #BeBest campaign. — WhileYouWereOut (@PivotAndDodge) May 8, 2018

The hypocrisy of Melania’s #BeBest campaign is beyond parody. @Flotus needs to begin her efforts with Don & her family.
