A leaked video shows the son of Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock hurling a series of insults, including homophobic slurs, at a police officer after the young man got pulled over for speeding.

In the clip, which was obtained Tuesday by Denver ABC affiliate KMGH and can be viewed above, Jordan Hancock berates the officer, calling him a “bitch” and a “faggot.”

“My dad’s the mayor, you fucking faggot,” the 22-year-old says. “I’m about to get you fired, you fucking bitch!”

The video appears to be taken from body camera footage dating back to March 23, when the younger Hancock was pulled over for driving 65 mph in a 40 mph zone in Aurora, a Denver suburb. The 20-second clip leaked to KMGH ends with the mayor’s son driving away in a huff after being issued a speeding ticket.

“Attitude very poor,” the officer wrote on the ticket, according to KMGH. “See video.”

Aurora is a separate municipality from Denver, with its own police department.

Jordan Hancock paid a $250 speeding fine after a brief court appearance on Monday, but did not speak to reporters. In a Tuesday tweet, his father said Jordan has since apologized to the officer, who has not been publicly identified.

The mayor termed his son’s actions “inexcusable,” and said he hoped the “personal mistake” would provide a “valuable lesson” for the community.

We've addressed our son's behavior at a traffic stop w/him. He's apologized to the officer. While we don't support nor condone his inexcusable actions & words, we love our son dearly & will work w/him to turn a personal mistake into a valuable lesson for himself & the community. — Michael B. Hancock (@MayorHancock) May 8, 2018

“The last thing we want are young men interacting with our police officers in that manner ― particularly African-American young men,” the mayor told 9NEWS. “And so he recognizes that and he certainly understands that the officer didn’t deserve the interaction that he had.”

Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz, in a statement released Tuesday, said the department had launched an internal investigation into the video leak.

The 20-second clip appeared to have been “improperly copied and disclosed,” he said, and the department would not be releasing the complete footage.

Two black, progressive prosecutors running for district attorney positions in North Carolina won their primaries Tuesday night, raising the prospect that the midterm elections in November will bring in a new wave of powerful, reform-minded district attorneys around the country.

Both candidates, Satana Deberry in Durham County and Faris Dixon in Pitt County, were backed by reform groups that are supporting prosecutors who can help roll back the failed policies of the drug war and end mass incarceration.

Progressives are spending millions to challenge local prosecutors around the country maintaining the status quo, aiming to replace them with criminal justice reform advocates. They are hoping to replicate what is already happening in Philadelphia, where new District Attorney Larry Krasner is reshaping the city’s criminal justice system with the goal of ending mass incarceration.

In Tuesday’s Democratic primary election, Deberry, a former criminal defense attorney, beat out incumbent prosecutor Roger Echols. With the rival Democrat’s defeat and facing no candidates from any other parties, Deberry is now set to become the county’s new district attorney.

Deberry had received the endorsement of the Color of Change political action committee, a group focused on electing reform-minded district attorneys around the nation. She has vowed to oppose cash bail, stand up to police misconduct and reject the return of the failed policies of the war on drugs.

Color of Change had been critical of Echols, who has been prosecutor in Durham since 2014, for not moving fast enough to reform the county’s criminal justice system. Echols’ supporters, however, argued that he had begun to implement some reforms, including allowing some defendants to complete a diversion program rather than be incarcerated and implementing an amnesty program that allows people to text or email to have their traffic records cleared.

“Throughout her campaign, Ms. Deberry repeatedly stressed that Durham could not continue to call itself the most progressive city in the South while over-prosecuting people of color and holding people in jail who simply can’t afford bail,” said Daniel Spiegel, senior legal counsel at the Justice Collaborative and a former public defender in Durham. “Her victory tonight shows how hungry this community is for a new vision of criminal justice reform.”

In Pitt County, Dixon beat Democratic challenger Derek Brown. A former assistant district attorney and current defense attorney in the county, Dixon supports the formation of a conviction integrity unit to review closed cases and ensure that defendants were not wrongfully convicted, expanding the use of drug courts in the region and creating more transparency out of the DA office.

Dixon will face off against the Republican candidate in November’s general election. Current county DA Kimberley Robb announced in January that she would not seek election to another term.

Deberry and Dixon’s victories were a “direct result of Durham’s Black residents showing up to the polls and sending a clear message about the changes they want for their criminal justice system,” said Rashad Robinson, spokesperson for Color Of Change PAC. “Now the real work begins,” he added, saying that Color Of Change PAC will remain deeply engaged in ensuring that both candidates hold true to their campaign promises.

Prosecutors are among the most powerful agents in the American criminal justice system. They have complete and unrivaled access to the evidence that can determine a person’s guilt or innocence, and broad powers over how seriously to take a charge against an individual and how aggressively to pursue a case. They determine the charges a defendant will face, and ultimately set the parameters for the punishment a person might receive.
