Seth Meyers could not get enough of a recent Axios report that claimed President Donald Trump’s daily schedule was getting shorter.

“President Trump is starting his official day much later than he did in the early days of his presidency, often around 11 a.m., and holding far fewer meetings,” Axios reported on Monday, referring to copies of Trump’s private schedule. The daily calendar of meetings and events reportedly differed from the version the White House made available to the public and press.

“I’m sorry, he starts his day at 11 a.m.?” Meyers asked on Tuesday broadcast of “Late Night.” “All I do is make fun of him and I still have to be here at 9 a.m.”

The schedule also reportedly included hours of “executive time,” which Axios described as “almost always ... TV and Twitter time alone in the residence.”The author of the best-seller Hillbilly Elegy, J.D. Vance, is now seriously considering a U.S. Senate run in Ohio and talking with Republicans in Washington, according to a BuzzFeed report.

Vance had previously ruled out a challenge to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) this year. But then the front-runner in the GOP primary, Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel (R), dropped out of the race last week. Mandel cited his wife’s health as his reason for withdrawing.

“The phone hasn’t stopped ringing since Friday,” Vance adviser Jai Chabria told BuzzFeed.

“The amount of support for J.D. Vance is incredible,” Chabria said, seemingly already in campaign mode. “People are starting to realize he has the best message to beat Sherrod Brown. J.D. is giving serious consideration toward this, because there are very serious people asking him to run.”

Mandel’s withdrawal has left Republicans scrambling to find a strong replacement. They have hopes of picking up the Senate seat: President Donald Trump won Ohio by 8 percentage points in 2016, and Brown’s victory over Mandel in 2012 was the only statewide success for Democrats in more than a decade.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spoke with Vance, according to Politico, and told associates he would prioritize the race if the former venture capitalist jumps in.

Currently, businessman Mike Gibbons is the sole Republican contender in the May primary, for which the filing deadline is Feb. 7. Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), who is currently running for governor, said Tuesday that he would consider moving over to the Senate race if Trump supported him.

“If the president would call, I would consider it, because I would need his help really at this late part of the game,” Renacci told Cleveland radio station WTAM. “But again, my commitment is still to try and change the state of Ohio, and if I can do that in a Senate seat with the backing of the president because he wants me to do it, I would clearly consider it only at that time.”Margot Robbie on the red carpet of the 2018 Golden Globes.

Um, is #HoneymoonGoals a thing?

The last person you expect to run into on your honeymoon is America’s favorite talk show host, let alone a former president, but so the story goes for “I, Tonya” star Margot Robbie.

The Australian actress tied the knot with husband Tom Ackerley in December 2016, but they took their honeymoon months later in Tahiti. After a few days on a secluded part of the island, the couple finished off the trip at a luxury hotel.

Robbie recounted the trip during an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Wednesday, including the very key detail that Ackerley was wearing revealing short shorts at the time.

“Tom puts on these shorts, his oldest gym shorts, and they’re tiny,” Robbie said. “And they’re like really short and there’s nothing underneath, so he gets on his bicycle to ride there and I’m like, ‘Whoa. Babe, you cannot wear those shorts. They’re like ― you can see everything.’ And he’s like ‘C’mon. Who are we going to run into?’”

That’s when they bumped into DeGeneres her wife Portia de Rossi, and Barack Obama, who were exercising in the hotel gym.

“The whole thing was so absurd,” Robbie said.

“It was a very confined space, and we then had to do this whole, like, class, this stretching class, and Tom meanwhile is trying to like, not reveal anything,” she added. “And he’s dying and I’m crying so much, I’m about to crack a rib.”

Robbie did, however, get some face time with Obama, who apparently is a major fan of the actress, calling her “very talented.”
