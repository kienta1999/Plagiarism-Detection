Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s longtime chief international correspondent, will also head up a new late-night program on PBS, the public television network told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday.

Dubbed “Amanpour & Company,” the public affairs program is set to premiere in July and will replace broadcasts of “Amanpour,” the CNN simulcast that PBS began airing after it cut ties with host Charlie Rose late last year amid the wave of sexual harassment allegations against him.

Though Amanpour will continue in her job as CNN’s chief international correspondent, she told The Hollywood Reporter that her PBS program will approach world news from a different angle.

″[I] am delighted for the opportunity it gives me to speak to Americans about what’s happening in the rest of the world and about how the world views America,” she said. “And I think these conversations can be really interesting. I’m not just doing breaking news every night. I’m not just doing world leaders. I’m also doing really interesting cultural conversations. I do think it’s a watershed moment right now.”Danny Alvarez, who was running for Jefferson County District Court judge in Kentucky, died on Wednesday after a primary victory. Facebook

An attorney running for judge in Kentucky collapsed and died Wednesday, the day after winning his race’s primary.

Danny Alvarez, a 43-year-old married father of three running for Jefferson County District Court judge in Louisville, collapsed at his home, according to local media. A cause of death was not immediately released.

His campaign consultant, Jonathan Hurst, described Alvarez as “a true public servant, a humanitarian, and a champion for human rights and the immigrant community” in a statement obtained by Louisville station WHAS.”

What Brennan should have done, he said, is hold his fire and “trust the process.”

“Go to the special counsel [Robert Mueller] and explain to the special counsel what your concerns are, if there are any, and avoid the damage that you would cause by the public statement that he made against the president.”Republican strategist Steve Schmidt blasted Donald Trump’s wild speech during a tax-touting roundtable talk in West Virginia on Thursday, saying the president sounded like a “drunk guy in Queens” spouting “total nonsense.”

Trump claimed that “millions and millions” of people in California voted illegally in the presidential election and that record numbers of women were being raped along the route of a group of migrants traveling from Central America into Mexico. There’s no evidence for either comment.

Trump sounded “like a drunk guy in Queens at the end of the bar talking complete and total nonsense,” Schmidt said on MSNBC. “That’s the president of the United States of America.

“Danny spent the day humbled and grateful to this community after his historic victory last night,” Hurst added. “He would want us to honor his memory by showing compassion and love to all people.”

Tanisha Ann Hickerson, who finished just behind Alvarez in the primary on Tuesday, said in a statement that his death “goes beyond elections, jobs and careers.”

“His passion for equality and his fight for fairness are unparalleled,” she said. “I will miss him terribly, and I’m praying for his wife and children.”

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also offered his condolences to Alvarez’s family, describing the lawyer as “a tireless advocate for justice, a vessel of hope and inspiration for so many.”

As for the NBA, its slowly been making strides at being a more inclusive organization.

In early 2014, Jason Collins became the first openly gay athlete to play in any of North America’s major professional sports leagues when he signed with the New Jersey Nets.

In August 2017, the NBA partnered with the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), a Washington-based advocacy group, to expand opportunities for LGBTQ businesses to work with the league. Descansa en paz. — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) May 24, 2018

Louisville Democrats expressed “shock and bewildered sorrow.”

“Our jubilation at his success has turned to grief at his passing,” the party’s chair, J. Russell Lloyd, said in a statement that praised Alvarez as “a friend, colleague, advocate and role model.”

For Wheeler, he enjoys learning from his grandparents and taking in the lessons he’s taught from older generations.

“My grandpa will sometimes talk about the things his family taught him to do to celebrate Lunar New Year, like the preparations and superstitious rituals that are or are not allowed,” he said. “He also talks about what his family did when he was a child and the things his parents did for him to move him ahead in life. I like listening to his stories and hope I can share with my kids what I learned from my grandpa.”

Ultimately, introspection remains at the core of the Lunar New Year spirit. And the trio will be doing just that.

“It’s a time for reflection, for thanking those who came before or who may have helped us get to where we are today,” Wheeler told HuffPost. “And it’s also a time to celebrate the traditions and family that make us who we are.”Spencer Platt via Getty Images

Stocks plummeted in pre-market trading on Wednesday as a herd of speculators briefly lost their wits over … not much, really.

The proximate cause of the stock plunge was almost universally identified as a monthly consumer price report from the Department of Labor. This is confusing for sane people, because the results of the report were quite good. Consumer prices rose by a half of 1 percent in January, on an annual path of 2.”Madonna has never been afraid to break taboos at the Met Gala over the years ― donning bunny ears, chugging rosé from a canteen and even flashing her derrière. But she found yet another way to make a splash at Monday’s event, reminding fans and A-list attendees why she’s still the Queen of Pop by giving them a stunning three-song performance.

The theme of this year’s gala was “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” ― which, frankly, seems tailor-made for Madonna, who has built her career on blurring the lines between religion and sexuality. True to form, the star descended the staircase in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Great Hall in a monk’s cloak singing her 1989 smash “Like a Prayer” with Gregorian chants in place of the song’s usual gospel choir.

She later removed the cloak to reveal a bustier and sheer skirt, both in pure white, for a dance break before segueing into Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.”

Vogue captured snippets of the performance for posterity on Instagram.

Meanwhile, fan site Madonna Nation shared additional footage.

Madonna’s set also included a sparse, and as-yet-unreleased, new tune.

“It’s a beautiful plan, but I’m not concerned. It’s a beautiful game, that I never learned,” she appeared to sing in the song, believed to be from a forthcoming album. “You have taught me to shut my mouth, so I don’t get burned. Keep your beautiful lies, ’cause I’m not concerned.”

She completed the look with a bejeweled crown and rosary necklaces by Indonesian designer Rinaldy Yunardi.

After four decades in the business, the famously lapsed Catholic said her childhood faith continues to influence her music and performances.

“When I first started, I was covered in rosaries, so nothing’s changed, really,” she told Vogue, as seen in the clip above. “Religious themes have always been a part of my work and always inspired me in everything that I do ― my music, my creativity, the way I dress.”.

Scaramucci’s interpretation of Trump’s behavior appears to differ from the president’s opinion of himself. During a speech Saturday at a campaign rally for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania, Trump said people would be “so bored” if he acted presidential.

“Don’t forget: This got us elected,“Trump said. “If I came like a stiff, you guys wouldn’t be here tonight.”

After his CNN spot Sunday, Scaramucci tweeted that Trump was “redefining” what it means to be presidential.
