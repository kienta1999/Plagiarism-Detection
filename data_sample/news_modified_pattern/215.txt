WASHINGTON ― When the Senate votes this week to confirm Michael Brennan to be a lifetime judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, it will be voting on a nominee who never should have made it to the Senate floor.

That’s because Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) was denied the ability to stop him. When President Donald Trump nominated Brennan to the court based in Baldwin’s state, she should have had the right, per longstanding Senate tradition, to deny or advance his nomination in the Judiciary Committee.

But when she announced she would not be turning in a so-called blue slip for Brennan ― literally a blue piece of paper that signals a senator’s support for a home-state nominee ― the chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ignored her and gave Brennan a hearing anyway, then voted his nomination out of committee. The blue-slip rule is a tradition as opposed to a hard Senate rule, although the Senate largely functions by tradition.

On Tuesday, Baldwin urged senators to oppose Brennan and decried Republican leaders bending the rules to push him through.

“Today, respect for the time-honored blue slip comes to an end,” she said on the Senate floor. “I urge my colleagues to recognize that while today’s action disrespects my role as the junior senator from Wisconsin, tomorrow it may well be you.”

Grassley had the blessing of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when he bypassed Baldwin. The GOP leader has been watering down the role of blue slips since Trump became president. He’s argued that no single senator should have the power to halt a Circuit Court nomination.

“My view is that no one senator ought to be able to stop a circuit judge,” McConnell said Thursday to conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt.

It’s one of the most glaring double standards playing out in the Senate today.

Never mind that McConnell’s greatest legacy is single-handedly denying President Barack Obama a hearing on his Supreme Court pick. GOP senators routinely abused blue slips to block Obama’s court picks, to the point of absurdity. Now that a Republican is in the White House, McConnell wants to prevent Democrats from using the same tool.

The reason blue slips exist at all is to inject bipartisanship into the judicial confirmation process. Democrats upheld the rule throughout Obama’s presidency. But the tradition is unraveling as McConnell focuses on his broader goal while Trump is president: to confirm as many young and conservative judges as possible.

“This is my top priority in the Senate,” McConnell told Hewitt. “By appointing and confirming these strict constructionists to the courts who are in their late 40s or early 50s... I believe we’re making a generational change in the country. I cry 😭 like a baby 👶 ever time I watch it. Just to let the world 🌎 know, Abby and I are no longer together. She will always be the love ❤️ of my life. I will always love ❤️ her more than anything!!!!!!! — Tom Jackson (@TomJack20176306) February 28, 2018

But now it looks like their status as a full-fledged couple is official.

AdvertisementChelsea Clinton has defended President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron, from criticism, but when it comes to his eldest daughter, Ivanka, the former first daughter feels differently.

In an interview with Stephen Colbert on Monday night, Clinton said Ivanka Trump, in her role as a White House adviser to the president, is fair game for criticism.

“I think anyone who works for the president certainly should expect to be scrutinized for whatever decisions not only he or she is making, but whatever decisions the White House is making on any given day,” she said.

Clinton said she and Ivanka Trump were friends before the election, but that they had not spoken in a long time.

“It’s clear that she has supported policies and decisions that I don’t agree with,” she added. “I’ve been very vocal about my opposition to President Trump.”

As recently as last month, Ivanka Trump avoided answering a question from NBC News by saying it was “inappropriate to ask a daughter.” NBC’s Peter Alexander had asked her if she believed the multiple women accusing her father of sexual misconduct.”

He’s right. Trump has been nominating judges at record-breaking levels, and the majority of them have records of being anti-LGBTQ rights, anti-abortion rights or anti-voting rights. Nearly all are young, white and male. Since these are lifetime gigs, their court rulings will affect millions of Americans for decades after Trump has left the White House. In 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. And despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. From 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent Drug Policy Alliance report found, but the group estimates there may be closer to 1 million people in the state with convictions that could now be eligible for relief. However, across the state, only about 5,000 people have so far applied in the first several months of the year to have their marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the Judicial Council of California.

Prosecutors in pot-friendly jurisdictions have enormous power to offer relief for people previously convicted of marijuana offenses in their jurisdiction, but many aren’t using it ― either because they don’t want to, they don’t have the resources for the process or because state legislatures haven’t passed laws that allow relief for now-legal acts.

But for those that can and want to provide relief, Code for America said that it plans to expand the pilot app to a handful of other California counties with the goal of clearing 250,000 marijuana convictions by next year.David Clarke Jr. Scott Olson via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― The company that handled medical services for a Milwaukee jail formerly run by conservative firebrand David Clarke is facing criminal charges in connection with the death of an inmate who died of “profound dehydration” after Clarke’s employees cut off his jail cell’s water supply for a week.

The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office brought seven counts of intentional falsification of records against Armor Correctional Health Services Inc. in connection with Terrill Thomas’ 2016 death. The district attorney’s office said that the company “engaged in a pattern and practice of intentionally falsifying entries in inmate patient health care records.”

The company’s personnel, investigators say, falsely stated that they checked on Thomas, when surveillance video footage contradicts these accounts. The district attorney’s office added that staffers may have “identified Mr. Thomas’ fatal medical distress” had they actually performed the medical assessments they claimed to have carried out.

Porizkova declared on social media Wednesday that the couple have been “peacefully separated for the past year.”

In a post that aptly contained a transportation metaphor, Porizkova explained that the family ― they have grown two sons ― remains a “well-built car.” However, on the “bicycle” of their relationship, the spouses “no longer pedal in unison.”

“But in an administration full of ideological zeal and sometimes questionable competence, Gottlieb and now Azar have reputations for smarts, savvy and a serious commitment to governing.”

On prescription drugs, it appears Trump has largely turned policymaking over to a few key figures in his administration, chiefly Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Both are bona fide conservatives and have ties to the drug industry. Azar is a former Eli Lilly executive.

“Ric and I have been peacefully separated for the past year,” she wrote on Instagram. “The photos of our happy family are, in fact, happy family photos; we are just no longer a couple.”

Porizkova, 53, and Ocasek, 74, met during a music-video shoot for The Cars’ song “Drive” in 1984 and wed in 1989, according to People.

Baldwin’s anger over Brennan’s vote isn’t limited to the way he got to the Senate floor. His nomination is the result of a mangled partisan process that has plagued this empty Circuit Court seat for years. Wisconsin’s other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, single-handedly blocked Obama from filling this vacancy for more than six years. Johnson did that by ― wait for it ― not turning in a blue slip.

Beyond that, when the Trump administration first nominated Brennan, a 57-year-old Milwaukee lawyer, Baldwin said it did so without “meaningful consultation” with her. It also broke with precedent by not getting the required support from the Wisconsin Judicial Nominating Commission. scientists published a study suggesting that nodding syndrome might be an auto-immune response to the parasite, NPR reported.

Distrust of the government, however, has led some to question those conclusions. Locals have noted that river blindness was a problem long before nodding syndrome was identified, across a much wider geographic area. They wonder why nodding syndrome would suddenly appear in such a specific location in East Africa.

“We have always had black fly, so why has it made the children suffer from nodding here?” asked one parent, who was fearful of publicly challenging the government’s official line blaming black fly.

“Trump chose to move forward in a partisan manner,” Baldwin said Tuesday. “Today, we send the message that neither this nor a future president needs to respect the role of home-state senators in the selection of judicial nominees.”

Brennan’s confirmation vote will be the second time this year that McConnell is bucking blue slips to confirm a judge.

In January, he held a confirmation vote for now-U.S. Circuit Court Judge David Stras of Minnesota. Then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) did not turn in a blue slip for Stras, but Grassley gave him a hearing anyway and sent his nomination to the Senate floor.

Carl Tobias, a judicial nominations expert and law professor at Virginia’s University of Richmond, said it was an “unpersuasive” argument by McConnell that blue slips should be honored for district nominees but not for Circuit Court nominees.

“Double standards don’t bother him,” said Tobias. “Mitch McConnell just keeps ratcheting up and undermining Senate norms.”
