Actress Geena Davis and husband Reza Jarrahy are divorcing after more than 16 years of marriage, Entertainment Tonight reported.

Jarrahy filed the papers on Tuesday, citing irreconcilable differences and requesting joint legal and physical custody of their teenaged daughter and twin sons, the site noted from court documents. He also asked for spousal support.

According to People, the filing featured the names “Rob Doe vs. Veronica Doe.”

The two separated in mid-November.

The Oscar-winning actress was previously hitched to director Renny Harlin, actor Jeff Goldblum, and restaurateur Richard Emmolo.Pauley Perrette’s Abby Sciuto said goodbye to “NCIS” on Tuesday and fans couldn’t handle it.

Perrette, who had built up that public affection over 15 seasons as the CBS crime show’s goth genius, had announced her planned departure in October, but that didn’t make the parting any less sorrowful.

But if you want to know what happened to dear Abby, Tuesday’s episode revealed that the forensic scientist has gone to a better place . subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. Westminster has been hit with a class-action lawsuit by Maryland tenants who say they were charged mysterious fees in a bid to drive them out, a charge the company has denied.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly looking into Jared Kushner’s efforts to secure financing for family real estate operations from foreign investors during the presidential transition that may have influenced his work in the White House.A federal judge lambasted Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) on Tuesday for failing to take adequate steps to comply with a court order and inform thousands of potentially confused voters that they were eligible to cast ballots.

The voters were the victims of a Kansas state law requiring people to prove they were U.S. citizens when they registered to vote at the motor vehicle department. Under the law, which went into effect in 2013, people who couldn’t provide that proof were first sent notices that their voter registration was incomplete and then, if they didn’t prove their citizenship within 90 days, were removed from the voter rolls altogether.

In 2016, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law. According to the transcript of a status conference that October, the judge asked whether the affected voters ― about 18,000 at the time ― would receive the postcard that Kansans typically receive before an election informing them of their polling location. Kobach assured her that his office was taking all steps necessary to make sure those individuals ― and anyone else who failed to prove their citizenship when registering to vote ― would be treated the same as other voters.

Overall, the American Civil Liberties Union estimates that the requirement to prove citizenship impacted around 35,000 voters. The ACLU is currently facing off against Kobach at trial in Robinson’s courtroom in Kansas City in an effort to permanently overturn the law... charity work! (What did you think we meant?)

After being shot in part one of her farewell arc, Abby awakened from a coma in part two to help solve her own shooting and the murder of Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry) in the same attack.

Abby announced she was escorting Reeves’ body back to London and wouldn’t be returning. “I’m leaving NCIS,” she said, adding that she was going to operate a charity that Reeves had wanted to start as a tribute to his late mother.

She makes the goodbye hug rounds and later signs “I love you” to Gibbs (Mark Harmon).

Twitter needed a hankie. QUICK.

Kushner has described himself as a “lifelong Democrat.” In 2016, he said through a spokesman that he would not be voting for Trump.

At the Women’s March in Washington the day after Trump was inaugurated last year, Kushner was photographed in a crowd of demonstrators. According to the Washingtonian, Kushner told other marchers he was there “observing.”

Trump and his Twitter account were unusually silent on Saturday as hundreds of thousands of protesters marched in cities across the U.S. and around the world demanding meaningful gun reform.

A White House spokeswoman commented on the rallies, saying, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights today. She is my favorite character! #NCIS #GoodbyeAbby — Aaron J. (@TheRealAJ_) May 9, 2018Actor Clayne Crawford’s outbursts on the set may have proved lethal.

The actor was fired from “Lethal Weapon” as the buddy-cop TV series finished its season on Tuesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

And it wasn’t looking good for his character, Martin Riggs, who was shot in the chest in the just-aired finale, TVLine noted.

Warner Bros. Television producers are attempting to find a replacement for Crawford as Fox prepares for a presentation to ad buyers on Monday, Variety reported, citing unnamed sources. “It is a sacred space where we can be who we are in all our flamboyant queerness and feel like nothing bad will happen. I have seen princesses even treat queers a little more special, cooing over their magical green hair or their pretty clothing. And queers beam, and I have held friends as they cried because, unlike so many other people in their lives, a princess recognized their queer magic and accepted it.”In an attempt to end inequality in the justice system, Manhattan’s district attorney has vowed to stop prosecuting minor marijuana cases.

District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced the new policy Tuesday, promising to decline to prosecute marijuana possession or smoking cases. Fueled by that claim, and by an early (and ultimately doomed) partnership with Walgreens, Theranos hit a valuation of around $9 billion in 2014.

But by 2016, as news began to spread that Theranos’ technology might not be up to snuff, the company’s value tanked, wiping out Holmes’ $4.5 billion net worth with it.

“Innovators... must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.” - San Francisco SEC Director Jina Choi

Wednesday’s SEC complaint asserts that the company’s claims about its technological abilities were misrepresentations at best and outright lies at worst.

For instance, Theranos claimed the U.S. Department of Defense deployed its portable blood analyzers to Afghanistan for use aboard medevac helicopters, generating $100 million in revenue in 2014.

Not only did the DOD never do such a thing, but Theranos’ 2014 revenues were actually closer to $100,000.

“You can’t fire me on my day off!” Crawford cried on Twitter.
