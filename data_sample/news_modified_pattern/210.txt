Stephen Colbert wants to help Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is now part of President Donald Trump’s legal team.

Giuliani over the weekend noted the difficulty in separating fact from opinion.

Colbert agreed it can be tough ― but offered a clear example on Monday’s “Late Show” for the former mayor.Looks like it’s good riddance to the bad blood between Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.

On Tuesday, Swift posted a tweet showing that Perry had sent her an olive branch as a gift to celebrate the opening night of her stadium tour in Glendale, Arizona.

The olive branch ― an ancient sign of peace ― came with a note that began:

“Hey old friend, I have been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us. I really want to clear the air ...”

TMZ reports that Perry also wrote she was “deeply sorry” about something, but the outlet wasn’t able to read further.

The peace offering came after Perry appeared to take a shot at Swift on “American Idol.”

Last May, Perry told talk show host James Corden the feud started when some of her usual dancers went to perform with Swift.

Hayek came forward in December, penning an essay for The New York Times in which she called Weinstein a “monster.” She said she, too, had experienced Weinstein’s repeated sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances, including massage and oral sex requests.Selfies, puppies and pizza are so yesterday. The next evolution of the feel-good awards show moment has arrived at the Oscars.

To show their appreciation for people who actually go see movies, host Jimmy Kimmel and a group of famous types — including Margot Robbie, Lupita Nyong’o, Armie Hammer, Gal Gadot, Ansel Elgort and Guillermo del Toro —surprised moviegoers during the ceremony.

While the awards were being handed out at the Dolby Theater, the group crashed a screening of “A Wrinkle In Time” around the corner ― during a scene featuring Oprah, we might add ― to thank fans for their undying support.

Perry said she had no problem with this, but asked the dancers to make sure their contracts included a provision allowing them to bow out when Perry went back on tour in a year. Since then, the senior has announced plans to attend Indiana State University next fall on a football scholarship. (Watch a January NBC report on Bain above.)

“My main reason for coming out was not necessarily for me,” he told local NBC affiliate KSDK in December. “For me, it was to try and reach out to people who aren’t comfortable coming out. I feel like, especially within athletics, there’s a stigma. I don’t think being an athlete and gay really collide.”

The school’s headmaster, Andy Abbott, told Fox 2 Now that more than 200 John Burroughs students expressed an interest last week in staging a counterprotest of their own in response to Westboro’s targeting of their classmate.

She said that when she was getting ready to tour, the dancers went to Swift’s management to discuss leaving ― and got fired.

As you might expect, the news that the two stars’ feud is over sent shock waves through the world. They could be friendly to each other, but we liked when they competed, not when they happily agreed to duets. We liked when they tossed insults behind backs in interviews, no matter how much an interviewer had to trap them into doing so.

“It is a bone-crushing spectator sport,” The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture author Daniel Harris wrote of diva worship.

Some music fans rejoiced that they’d no longer have to pick sides.

Others didn’t know what to think.

Yet the assignment wasn’t just about dress-up. Alexandra also had to research her subject, write a two-page report, create a poster board presentation and prepare a one-minute speech to deliver as Obama during her school’s open house.

Thanks to all that research, Alexandra learned a lot about the former first lady and was able to draw parallels between Obama’s life and her own.

“We live in an area with a very, very small black community,” Dow explained. “There may be only two other families in her school that are black. When she sees Michelle on TV, she feels so connected to her because she’s brown like her. When she did this project and saw pictures of Michelle as a little girl for the first time, she said, ‘Look! She has hair like mine.’”

Another cool thing Alexandra learned about Obama is that she went to Princeton, just like her mom. In fact, Dow had Alexandra while she was attending the university.

“She was so struck by the fact that Michelle’s teachers had said not to apply to Princeton because she was reaching too high,” Dow recalled, while emphasizing the importance of children seeing themselves reflected in our leaders.

“Alexandra said that sometimes people want to hold you down, but you just have to believe in yourself.”Travis Allen and five other current or former California lawmakers have been investigated by the state legislature for alleged harassment.com/Ju6pNw0JfL — Hannah wants to hug Taylor on 15/06/18 (@Hannah_Swiftie) May 8, 2018

Some people put the thaw in proper perspective.

If Katy Perry can stop hating Taylor Swift, every random verified blogger with less than 3,000 followers can too. — xgiacoppox126-Vinnie (@xgiacoppox126) May 8, 2018

Some were relieved things could go back to normal.

Katy & Taylor are back 💖💓💗 @katyperry @taylorswift13

And one woman predicted the logical next step. It’s not unusual to have some turnover after a president’s first year in office, but this White House’s revolving door is far more active than any recent administration.
