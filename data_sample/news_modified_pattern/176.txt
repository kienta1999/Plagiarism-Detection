Let’s get something out of the way: Selena Gomez is a goddess among us mere mortals and has cornered the market on turning looks time and time again.

That being said, something was a bit off when she walked the red carpet at the Met Gala in New York on Monday wearing a sheer custom-made Coach gown.

Now the dress, which was admittedly more straightforward than some of the night’s outlandish looks (see Katy Perry’s literal angel wings), wasn’t the problem. It was her presumed over-eager spray tan, which fans were quick to roast on social media after Gomez stepped out looking a bit more orange than usual.

Unlike every other person in attendance for the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” exhibit, Gomez had yet to mention the event on Instagram, where she happens to be the most-followed celebrity in the world.

She broke her silence on #TanGate (yeah, that’s what we’re calling it) on Wednesday, seemingly poking fun at her Met Gala mishap.

In the video, Gomez is seen sprinting away from the camera and into the backseat of a van as her dress trails behind her.

“Me when I saw my pictures from MET 🤷🏽‍♀️,” she captioned the post.

Given all that she’s gone through in the past year (a kidney transplant, reuniting with Justin Bieber, being dragged on the daily by her mom) Gomez is nothing if not resilient.

And, hey, if you can’t laugh at yourself, then who can you laugh at? Just kidding, you can always laugh at Bieber.Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, center, has been elected the new prime minister of Armenia. Gleb Garanich / Reuters

YEREVAN (Reuters) - Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was elected as Armenia’s new prime minister on Tuesday, capping a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism in the ex-Soviet republic.Actress Arielle Kebbel’s sister has been missing for days, and she’s asking people on social media to help in the search.

Kebbel, who’s starred in TV series like “Unreal,” “Ballers” and “Vampire Diaries,” is trying to locate Julia Kebbel, who apparently was last seen on the night of Jan. 31 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles walking her chocolate Labrador.”

“They have money and power to give jobs and they use that for their own sexual gratification and there’s no better way to visualize this than the way we did with the casting couch,” he said.

The best way to take down powerful people is to “poke fun,” Monroe added.

“As Mark Twain once said, ‘Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.’”

People on Twitter had mixed reactions to the statue:

What the hell @ the Harvey Weinstein statue — T'Laurd of Wakanda👑 (@mordenash) March 2, 2018

This Harvey Weinstein statue is the biggest example of any exposure is positive since boonk and supreme patty — Cameron Wells (@CameronWlls) March 2, 2018

So we rid the country of all the great historical statues and pay homage to this crap? If they are so disgusted by him why do they even want it around? Is it a joke now? Sure seems that way. #Hypocriteshttps://t.

The actress took to Instagram last week to alert her followers and provide photos and details about her sister’s disappearance. Their favorite example is Sutter Health Care, the hospital network now facing a state lawsuit over allegedly anti-competitive practices that have driven up prices in Northern California. Sutter says it has engaged in no such behavior.

“We have a system where the price of health care is unrelated to the cost of providing it, or outcomes, but rather to the relative power of hospitals and medical groups in the region,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy organization that is one of the bill’s major supporters.

The Debate to Come

A national debate over government regulation of health care spending, as part of a single-payer proposal or simply on its own, would likely spark similar arguments. It would also raise questions about money for research ― specifically, whether having government dictating so many fees could stunt innovation or at least steer it in the wrong direction.

The potential effects on innovation are particularly worrisome to some economists who fear that the impact might not be apparent for many years, if at all, making it impossible to undo before the damage sets in. “People don’t think enough about that long-term trade-off, because it’s not readily observable ― you don’t see the drug that’s not developed,” said Craig Garthwaite, an economist at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who specializes in the pharmaceutical industry.

“ALERT. My SiSTER JULIA KEBBEL is MISSING. She was last seen in silver lake, walking her chocolate lab, Cindy, at 11 pm wed night. 1/31/18,” the star wrote.

People reported there was a fire in Julia Kebbel’s apartment the day she went missing.

Arielle Kebbel later posted a missing persons flyer with her sister’s description.

“She has tattoos on both fore arms. She has a spiritual symbol with a key and the words promise on one forearm and a blue Phoenix rising on the other,” the flyer says.

Moscow, which has a military base in Armenia, is wary of an uncontrolled change of power which would pull the country out of its orbit, but Pashinyan has offered assurances that he will not break with the Kremlin.

The election of Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor who spent time in prison for fomenting unrest, marks a rupture with the cadre of rulers who have run Armenia since the late 1990s.

He spearheaded a protest movement that first forced veteran leader Serzh Sarksyan to step down as prime minister and then pressured the ruling party to abandon attempts to block his election as prime minister, the country’s most powerful post.

In a vote in parliament on Tuesday, 59 lawmakers backed Pashinyan’s candidacy, including some from the ruling Republican Party, with 42 voting against.

In a vote last week, the Republican Party blocked Pashinyan, but it said on Tuesday it had decided to get behind him for the sake of unity and the good of the nation.

A central square in the capital, where Pashinyan’s supporters gathered to watch the voting on huge television screens, erupted into joy when the result was shown.

The tens of thousands of people in Republic Square shouted “Nikol!” and white doves were released into the air. People hugged and kissed each other.

“We will view any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies, be it of small, medium or any force, as a nuclear attack on our country,” he said.

“Our response will be immediate. Nobody should have any doubts about that.”

Putin said that Russia did not plan to attack anyone, however. Russia’s growing military might was a guarantee of world peace, he said, designed to preserve a strategic balance of power on the planet.Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment hold a sign as they are introduced in the gallery of the Virginia House earlier this month.

“I’m the happiest person in the world,” said Shogik, a 17-year-old Pashinyan supporter.

Armenia is a country of about three million people nestling in mountains between Turkey and Iran.

Pashinyan’s protest movement was sparked when Sarksyan, barred by the constitution from seeking another term as president, became prime minister instead.

“Dad” — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 6, 2018

When another fan questioned him about the interpretation since Gunn does not have a writer or director credit in “Infinity War” (though Drax actor Dave Bautista said he did write some dialogue for the film), Gunn gave a pretty pragmatic answer:

It was in the screenplay. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 7, 2018

Needless to say, many fans felt a whole lot like this.

Gunn sure likes to drop mind-blowing fact-bombs about Groot on Twitter.

In February, he shook the social media platform when he revealed that Baby Groot in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” was actually the son of Groot — a full-grown tree man who gave his life to protect his friends in “Guardians of the Galaxy.”

In “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Baby Groot is grown from a twig of the dead Groot, and many fans assumed that Baby Groot was a reincarnation of Groot and not his son.

Fingers crossed that Rocket saved another twig somewhere!Kanye West and Kim Kardashian looking happy together at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images

Anything related to Kanye West these days comes with a massive caveat due to his still-unfolding Twitter meltdown (side note: please, PLEASE stop), but if there’s one saving grace, it’s his relationship with Kim Kardashian.

It’s been four years since the couple’s lavish Italian wedding, which was somewhat surprisingly not featured on the family’s reality show. On Thursday, Kardashian threw back to the big day with a previously unseen photo of the two. Predictably, West is not smiling in the pic. Many Armenians saw that as a cynical ploy by Sarskyan to extend his hold on power.
