President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Hoekstra, has finally admitted that his 2015 comments claiming there were “no go” violent zones in the nation because of Muslim immigrants had been baseless.

“Looking back, I am shocked I said that,” Hoekstra said in an interview published Friday in the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, according to The Washington Post. Lt. Steve Saunders, a public information officer for the department, said it is aware of the incident and is actively investigating.

While Meredith is saddened by the loss of the documents, he is heartened by the response of his congregants, who have been supportive of his relationship since he arrived at the church in July 2012,he said.

“They are a marvel as a United Methodist congregation,” he said. “Even when the denomination leans toward the suggestion that there is no place for LGBTQ persons, pastors, their families or congregations, this congregation steps in a little deeper. “It was a wrong statement. It was wrong.”

Hoekstra claimed at a 2015 anti-terrorism conference that Muslims were causing “chaos in the Netherlands,” burning cars and politicians and creating “no-go zones” in that country.

He told De Telegraaf that he couldn’t recall what his comments were based on.

“I mixed up countries. I was wrong. I can’t recall how that could happen. I know: I was wrong,” he said.

Hoekstra has been scorched by the Dutch over the comments, and his De Telegraaf interview appeared to be an attempt to make amends after a tough week.

During his first news conference on Wednesday, Dutch journalists refused to let Hoekstra off the hook and peppered the former Republican congressman from Michigan with questions asking if he still believed those widely debunked claims.

Hoekstra then doggedly refused to retract his past comments or provide concrete examples to back up his claims, The Washington Post reported. The Dutch journalists responded to his reluctance by piling on their questions.

“Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands in the past? Is that something you believe? Yes or no?” one reporter asked.

“Could you please take back the remark about burned politicians or name the politician that was burned in the Netherlands?” another asked.

“Why don’t you answer the question?” others chimed in, after Hoekstra attempted to move on.

At one point, a frustrated journalist declared, “This is the Netherlands. You have to answer questions.”

Roel Geeraedts, a reporter at the Dutch television station RTL Nieuws, tweeted a video of the tense news conference. “The only one who did get burned today is... Hoekstra himself. By refusing to answer our questions,” he wrote.

Hoekstra made those claims about Islam during a recorded panel discussion in November 2015. The panel was sponsored by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles-based organization known for promoting anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim ideologies.

“The Islamic movement is now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos,” Hoekstra said back then, according to Reuters. “Chaos in the Netherlands ― there are cars being burned. There are politicians that are being burned and, yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.”

In fact, there have been no instances of modern Dutch politicians being set on fire, Geeraedts noted in his tweet.

The rumor about Muslims in the Netherlands or other parts of Europe creating no-go zones where non-Muslims aren’t welcome is also unsubstantiated, although the myth is often promoted by right-wing groups and individuals seeking to spread misinformation about Islam.

Hoekstra has often made erroneous comments about Muslims and their faith. He has speculated that up to 15 percent of all Muslims could be radical extremists, according to CNN. Given that there are roughly 1.8 billion Muslims in the world, that would amount to about 270 million people.co/POnUGzfQIE pic.twitter.com/ZNE6sXv560 — CSPAN (@cspan) March 13, 2018

She said she could “talk a lot about private planes ... and doors, but there are also very important public policy issues here that I hope to focus on.”

The doors reference also caused Zinke to bristle. He said he was prepared to go through his expenses “line by line.”

Cantwell said public concern is growing over how money is being spent at Interior, as the Trump administration looks to slash the department’s budget by 15 percent while proposing to drastically hike entrance fees at 17 of America’s most popular national parks.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) also blasted Zinke, accusing him of a “shell game with a wildfire account at Interior to pay for an unrelated helicopter ride.”

He said voting to confirm Zinke to lead the agency was one of his “biggest regrets” during his time in the Senate.

He’s also claimed in the past that Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide Huma Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. That conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked.

Last month in Washington, a Dutch reporter from the Nieuwsuur television program questioned Hoekstra about the “no-go zones” comment. Hoekstra asserted he hadn’t said that ― again, even though his 2015 remarks were recorded.Trump was roundly mocked on Twitter after he floated the idea of creating a new branch of the U.S. military dedicated to fighting wars in space on Tuesday.

Dutch journalist to new US Ambassador: you said there were 'no go zones' in Netherlands, where are they?

When HuffPost asked about the clash at this week’s press conference, a U.S. State Department spokesperson pointed to a tweet that Hoekstra sent out in December addressing the interview with Nieuwsuur. In that tweet, the ambassador expressed “regret” about the exchange.

Hoekstra was born in the Netherlands and moved to the United States as a young child. The onetime congressman, who served from 1993 to 2011, sat for a period on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

In 2014, he joined the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a nonprofit that claims to be the “world’s most comprehensive data center on radical Islamic terrorist groups.) These refugees’ lives following resettlement, however, were not given continued attention.

“There’s a lot of support when you immediately come here ― finding them housing right away, getting settled into the neighborhood,” said Katrina Dizon Mariategue, who heads up the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center’s immigration policy and mass incarceration work. “But it’s all short-term remedies.”

“We would get called "chinks" and "Chinamen," even though we weren’t even Chinese. absolute security is unfortunately not possible.”

Seehofer was speaking in Muenster, where a man drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant on Saturday, killing two of them before shooting himself dead. Authorities have said the attacker was a 48-year-old German citizen with mental health problems and that there was no indication of an Islamist militant connection.BUDAPEST ― Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán looks set to easily win a third consecutive term in Sunday’s election and further cement his grip on the country, according to early official results.

“This has been a decisive win,” Orbán told crowds of supporters outside his party headquarters in Budapest.

The country’s National Election Office projects that Orbán’s right-wing nationalist Fidesz party will win a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which would allow it to make changes to the constitution. In the lead-up to the vote, critics warned that such a majority would give Orbán free rein to impose restrictive laws against NGOs and undermine Hungary’s democratic institutions.

Hungarians turned out in large numbers across the country to vote on Sunday, bringing to close an election campaign filled with anti-migrant rhetoric and nationalist fervor. The vote has drawn international attention not only for its spiteful campaign rhetoric and the implications for the country, but because opponents fear Orbán’s rule threatens to create immense rifts in the European Union and provides a model of illiberalism that could spread to other states.

At polling stations in the more liberal capital of Budapest, long lines of voters gathered throughout the day to cast their ballots, while some expressed their disdain at the government’s overwhelmingly negative campaign.

Refugees were often resettled in poorly funded urban centers like Long Beach and Stockton, California, or the Bronx, New York. According to a paper in the Asian American Law Journal, resettlement programs also failed to account for the linguistic and historical differences between Southeast Asian refugees and refugees from other regions. Once in the U.” It was founded by Steve Emerson, a self-proclaimed terrorism expert whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled an anti-Muslim extremist with a history of spreading misinformation about Islam.

The Investigative Project on Terrorism quotes Hoekstra praising it as a “national treasure whose influence and achievements are unparalleled.”

Trump nominated Hoekstra to the position of ambassador this past July. He was confirmed by the Senate in November.
