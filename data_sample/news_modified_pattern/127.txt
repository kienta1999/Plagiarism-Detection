He repeated an outline of an immigration plan the White House had released earlier that proposes protecting 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who were brought into this country as children in return for building his border wall and drastically cutting the numbers of legal immigrants.

Other policy proposals in his 80-minute speech, however, were far more vague: Vows to rebuild roads and bridges, help prison inmates re-enter society, battle the opioid addiction epidemic, lower the price of prescription drugs, and negotiate better trade agreements were tossed out with virtually zero details.

On trade, for instance, Trump repeated his desire for agreements that were “reciprocal” ― which Peterson Institute for International Economics trade expert Monica de Bolle said she found “baffling.”

“If it meant everyone should abide by the same rules, those already exist with institutions like the WTO, which President Trump has bashed in the recent past,” she said.Allergy sufferers, be warned.

Eric Henderson sent a gigantic cloud of pollen into the air after tapping a tree trunk with his backhoe in Millville, New Jersey.

“When my husband said the pollen’s bad, I probably should’ve taken his word for it,” Henderson’s wife, Jennifer, wrote on Facebook Monday.twitter.com/tl3TbyGA8Y — Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) February 7, 2018

And on Friday, White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned after his ex-wife accused him of physically abusing her.

Trump himself, a man who once bragged about being able to grab women “by the pussy,” has been accused by more than 20 women of sexual misconduct and abuse. It might not come as a surprise, then, that Trump would be eager to protect those accused of misconduct and abuse rather than those who say they’ve been victimized by it.

“Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?” the president asked in a tweet. It’s a fair question, for sure. It’s also something Trump has previously not seemed to care about. Here are just a few times that “due process” didn’t matter to Trump.

The Central Park Five

In 1989, a group of black and Hispanic men were convicted but later exonerated in the rape of a female jogger in New York City’s Central Park.

As police coercion and false allegations ruined these men’s lives, Trump spent $85,000 to place ads in four daily New York City newspapers to demand the innocent men be killed.

“Muggers and murderers should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,” Trump wrote in the ad at the time. “Crazy!”

The above clip has now gone viral, with more than 4.7 million views.

The video also was shared on Twitter by The Weather Channel meteorologist Mike Seidel, who called it a “pollen bomb.”

Seidel’s post prompted many people to make the same point in reply:

But the “World of Dance” judge faced a tough challenge on “The Tonight Show” Wednesday.

She and host Jimmy Fallon competed to see who could dance fast to the “least danceable” slow songs of the ’70s, like “Three Times A Lady” by the Commodores.

Lopez was definitely game.Yale Police responded to a call in the early hours of Tuesday, May 8 at 1:40 a.m. The caller reported that she was a student at the Hall of Graduate Studies (HGS) and said that there was a woman sleeping in the common room on the 12 floor, and that she did not know who the person was. Three police officers responded to HGS around 1:45 a.m., where the caller met them at the entrance and showed them her ID. She then let them up in the elevator, which stopped at the fifth floor where another student appeared.

At this point, the caller pointed to the other student and said, “This is her. “This is an objective condition . But now it seems like they never have any of the films I’m looking for. I have Amazon Prime, but any of the movies I really want to see inevitably require that I pay extra to rent them. The number of B and C-grade movies that are on these services is quite remarkable. That’s a lot of chaff to pad their offerings.” ― Susan HoustonMarco Rubio and Ivanka Trump have a plan. It has some issues. The Washington Post via Getty Images

Sen... and then the sanction is lifted.”

The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days.

“We hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,” it said in a statement.

“In light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.”

Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks.

“I’m very disappointed,” said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation.” Protocol is for police to separate the parties involved, so two officers stayed with the woman on the fifth floor and the investigating officer went with the caller to the 12th floor.

The investigating officer spent over 11 minutes initially with the caller to assess the situation, while the other two officers spent about 15 minutes with the other woman to assess the situation and to confirm her identity. After reviewing the scene in the 12 floor common room and seeing a computer, books, and notebooks in addition to a blanket and pillow on the couch, the investigating officer determined that the person who had been sleeping in the common room was likely a student, so the officer asked the caller to wait in her room on the 12 floor.

The investigating officer reported what she found to the other two officers on the fifth floor and to a supervisor who had arrived to assess the situation and determine whether assistance was needed. The officers were having a difficult time confirming the other student’s identification due to the use of the student’s preferred name in the system that was different from the official name on the ID. The supervisor worked with dispatch and security to clear up the matter, taking down the student’s information and giving her a case number. The assessment of the ID took about 15 minutes, which is longer than usual.

At that point, the investigating officer, with her supervisor, went to the 12 floor, where they spoke to the caller again for another seven minutes.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the plans “deeply shameful.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Harris released a joint letter to Holman asking to be “immediately briefed on the troubling reports.”

The state enacted two laws in 2017 to provide greater protection for immigrants in California. SB-54, known as the “sanctuary state” law, bars state and local law enforcement in most cases from using their resources, including equipment or personnel, to help with immigration enforcement. Personnel are also barred from asking residents about their immigration status and, in many cases, are barred from giving federal immigration officials access to people in custody.

AB-450, the Immigrant Labor Protection Act, deals specifically with the workplace. It bars employers from granting federal officials access to a workplace or employment records unless the authorities have a subpoena or warrant. Employers must also warn workers if their records are being reviewed by federal officials.

Becerra said guidelines are being prepared to help businesses understand what the law requires.WASHINGTON ― A day before a government shutdown, House Republican leaders cut a last-minute deal with conservatives to get a one-month spending bill out of their chamber and on to the Senate floor. But that legislation to extend government funding still faces challenges, particularly after conservatives won concessions that could set up a shutdown in the coming weeks and the Senate delayed a vote late Thursday night. Another officer also followed. They informed the caller that the student who had been in the common room was an authorized resident who had every right to be there. They also explained that this was not a police matter and were reporting the incident to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Officers left HGS Studies at about 2:34 a.m.
