President Donald Trump will likely meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore next month, according to several media reports.

Both CNN and Fox News, citing people familiar with the plans, said officials have been told to begin preparations for the summit after Trump ruled out the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula as a possible location. The White House has confirmed that a date and site have been set, but the announcement has not been made publicly.

Trump said he would reveal the details in three days.

“I can tell you that a date and location are set, but, beyond that, I don’t have any other announcements at this point,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday.

Kim expressed support for the summit in a statement given to North Korean state television on Wednesday, saying the event would be a “historic meeting” and a first step toward the “building of a good future” on the Korean Peninsula.

The news comes shortly after newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim and finalize details of the meeting.

During the Wednesday visit, Pompeo secured the release of three American prisoners that had been held in North Korea. The U.S. had long demanded that North Korea free the men, Kim Dong-chul, Kim Hak-song and Tony Kim, who had been held on charges of espionage and “hostile acts.”

“I’m thrilled that we have them back,” Pompeo told reporters, according to The New York Times. You appeal to everybody. That group broke for Trump 52 to 37 percent, while those who decided earlier voted for Clinton 50 to 47 percent.

“They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.” - Special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment against multiple Russians

Trump has been deeply sensitive to the appearance that he did not earn the presidency on his own. That’s one of the reasons, according to those close to him, why he has repeatedly pushed the false claim that he lost the popular vote because “millions” of undocumented immigrants supposedly cast ballots for Clinton. It is also why Trump has resisted admitting that Russians interfered in the election at all, let alone tried to boost his candidacy, sources close to him told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.

The fact of Russian interference in the election and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s preference for Trump was detailed in a Jan. 6, 2017, report released by the U.S. intelligence agencies. That conclusion was reinforced by Mueller’s Feb. 16, 2018, indictment.

“They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,” the indictment states. The parties have gotten good at appealing to the middle voter.”

Jenny Tilby Stock, a visiting research fellow at the University of Adelaide, said compulsory voting also encouraged voters to pay attention to politics and policy, to ensure that their vote went to the right party. “It encourages people to think about who they want to run the country. “President Trump set conditions for this to happen, and I am thrilled with that.”

The secretary also appeared optimistic about the summit, telling Kim at a lunch in Pyongyang that he was “hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.”

The three former prisoners are scheduled to arrive at Joint Base Andrews, outside Washington, D.C., at 2 a.m. Thursday and will be met by the president. All are reportedly healthy and able to walk on their own.

“I will be there to greet them,” Trump tweeted. “Very exciting!”The second season of the FX true crime anthology series explores the murder of fashion designer Versace (played by Édgar Ramírez) by serial killer Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss). It’s based on Maureen Orth’s 1999 book about the case, Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History.)Fox News host Sean Hannity had a follower walk into his Long Island, New York, home ― and he wasn’t welcomed.

Former dentist Jan Gilbert, 72, of Long Beach, New York, was charged with trespassing after entering the conservative commentator’s house on the afternoon of Feb. 17, according to reports on Wednesday.

Gilbert wrangled his way into Hannity’s Centre Island mansion by telling an unnamed person outside the home that he was writing a book about the Fox News personality, and needed to give him some papers, according to court documents cited by The Associated Press. Gilbert then followed that person into the house, AP reported.

Hannity’s wife, Jill, told police that she spotted Gilbert inside without permission and that she did not know him. She said Gilbert then left the house and sat in his car on the driveway, where police found him, Newsday reported.

Gilbert was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass.

He told Newsday “someone misheard, fabricated or misunderstood” the encounter. “There is a real reason, a valid reason, a superior reason and a fully confirmed reason, but I’m not going to be able to talk about it,” he said.

According to a real estate listing site, Billy Joel and Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch have lived in the posh area.

Hannity did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.Taylor Swift isn’t getting satisfaction from Keith Richards.

The “Hero” singer posted the first photo of one of their twins on Instagram Tuesday. In the picture, Iglesias is snuggled up to the baby, who’s dressed in an adorable white-and-gray onesie.

“My Sunshine,” the new dad captioned the photo.

Back in December, the famously private couple secretly welcomed twins, Nicholas and Lucy, in Miami.

The 74-year-old Rolling Stones guitarist took a swipe at the 28-year-old pop star’s success, saying, “Good luck girl ― wish her well while it lasts.”

Richards made the snide comment in The Wall Street Journal Magazine posted Wednesday, and appeared to try to soften the dig as well.

On Monday, the Verace family released a statement distancing themselves from the series, saying it had “neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever” in the show, calling it “a work of fiction.”

Murphy, in turn, rebutted those remarks Tuesday.

Upon rescinding the Obama-era guidance last year, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with a small group of transgender children and families to discuss issues facing this group of students. Vanessa Ford attended the meeting with her six-year-old transgender daughter, Ellie. During the meeting, DeVos mentioned that she had a young granddaughter, just like Ellie.

Ford told HuffPost that she found the news today “mind boggling.”

“We put our family at risk meeting with her in hopes it would make change. She now made the decision for the Department of Education that my daughter and thousands of daughters and sons shouldn’t have the protection her grandchildren should be afforded,” said Ford.

Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, said that after the Trump administration first rescinded the student guidance last year, they saw school districts who had been supporting transgender students suddenly change course. In spite of the fashion house’s claims, the “Glee” and “American Horror Story” producer told EW his latest project is “a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements.”

Interestingly, Murphy claimed that Donatella Versace, who took over the Versace label after her brother’s 1997 death, had recently been in contact with Penelope Cruz, who portrays her in the series.

“After I offered the role to Penelope, she said, ‘OK, I’m interested, but I’m friends with Donatella and I’m not going to do it unless Donatella is cool with it.’ So she called Donatella,” he said, noting that the designer had sent Cruz a bouquet of flowers prior to the Golden Globes.

Donatella, Murphy explained, is portrayed on the show “in a true feminist light as a feminist hero.”

By Wednesday, the Versace family had fired back at Murphy and the “American Crime Story” team once more.

“The company producing the series claims it is relying on a book by Maureen Orth, but the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation,” the family wrote in a second statement to EW and The Hollywood Reporter. Orth, who has worked for Vanity Fair since 1988, “never received any information from the Versace family” and instead presented “second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions” to create a “lurid” and “sensational” story.

“Gianni Versace was a brave and honest man, who engaged in humanitarian work for the benefit of others,” the statement continued. “Of all the possible portrayals of his life and legacy, it is sad and reprehensible that the producers have chosen to present the distorted and bogus version created by Maureen Orth.”
