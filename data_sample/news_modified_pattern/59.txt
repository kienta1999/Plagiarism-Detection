Jaylen Brown has spoken out about racism in the U.S. in the age of Donald Trump.

In an interview with The Guardian published Tuesday, the Boston Celtics star said Trump’s presidency has “made it a lot more acceptable for racists to speak their minds.”

“I just think Trump’s character and some of his values [make] him unfit to lead,” he said.S. Each remote operator like Tsurankou could mean four of today’s drivers losing their jobs.

In fact, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report predicts that robotics and artificial intelligence will put more low-skilled jobs at risk than previous waves of technological progress. With a few exceptions, such as care workers, the jobs most at risk from automation are those requiring the lowest levels of skill and education.

In the near future, it seems that the very people who are least equipped to work with and for algorithms and robots are those who will be expected to do so first. Uber’s biggest impact on society could turn out to be not its sharing or gig economy, but the normalization of bosses sitting in a server farm rather than a corner office, and the eradication of anything approaching a career path.

It’s scary to be honest.”

The 21-year-old also shared details of the racist abuse he endured on the court during his youth in Marietta, Georgia. Two prominent Canadian gymnastics coaches were recently charged with sexual offenses, and a third was suspended amid allegations that he sexually abused minors decades ago. Albert Schultz, the co-founder of one of Canada’s leading theater companies, was forced to step down last month after four actresses accused him of sexual harassment.

More than 2,400 women have initiated sexual harassment or discrimination claims against the RCMP, Canada’s national police force, and lawyers expect that number could soon rise to 4,000. The organization has a long history of mistreating its female recruits. Currently, two former RCMP doctors are facing a total of no less than 80 complaints of sexual misconduct.

“I’ve had people call me the n-word,” he said. “I’ve had people come to basketball games dressed in monkey suits with a jersey on. I’ve had people paint their face black at my games. I’ve had people throw bananas in the stands.”

Brown praised former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick for sparking protests against police brutality and systemic racial injustice by taking a knee during the national anthem before NFL games last season.

“Often everybody is comfortable with their role in life and they forget about the people who are uncomfortable,” he said. “So for Colin to put his career on the line, and sacrifice himself, was amazing.”

″[Kaepernick] speaks for many people in this country ― including me,” Brown added... get it, or maybe he already did.

Exes Bella Hadid and The Weeknd have apparently rekindled their romance after they were spotted kissing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival over the weekend, according to multiple outlets.

The supermodel and the R&B singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, apparently packed on the PDA during rapper Travis Scott‘s set at Poppy nightclub’s Coachella pop-up, with onlookers declaring that they “definitely looked like they were fully back together,” according to People.

In 2016, the two split after 18 months together, reportedly due to their busy schedules, only to reunite as exes on the Victoria’s Secret runway for a fashion show ― stars, they’re just like us.

The “Starboy” singer went on to date Selena Gomez, but the two ended their relationship in October 2017 with the former Disney star getting back together with ex Justin Bieber shortly after.

Brown also offered his thoughts on David Foster Wallace, the Arabic alphabet and the psychological role of sports in society.

AdvertisementAustralian scientist and right-to-die advocate David Goodall chose to end his life with a lethal injection on Thursday. He was 104.

Goodall died at a clinic in Switzerland while listening to the final movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, a melody known to music lovers around the world as “Ode to Joy.”

The day before, the botanist and ecologist told reporters he was not afraid of death and had no hesitations about ending his life. Goodall was not terminally ill, but his health had deteriorated badly in recent years, according to The New York Times.

“I no longer want to continue life, and I’m happy to have a chance tomorrow to end it,” he said during a press conference on Wednesday.

Assisted dying is banned in Australia, where the British-born Goodall lived for the last part of his life. However, there are some changes in the works ― last fall, the state of Victoria became the first in the country to legalize assisted dying in specific cases. Starting in June 2019, terminally ill patients who have a life expectancy of less than six months can request a lethal drug to end their lives.

Goodall is an advocate for medically assisted death for the elderly. He has been a member of Exit International, a right-to-die organization, for about 20 years.

Goodall flew from his home in Perth to an assisted-dying center in Basel. Switzerland is the only country that offers these services to foreigners. Since Monday, he’s had consultations with doctors, including a psychiatrist, and was visited by the Swiss police.

Reporters at the conference on Wednesday pressed Goodall about whether there was anything that he still wanted to do, or anything that he would miss about life. The scientist replied that he hasn’t been able to do some of things he enjoys for a while.

“There are many things I would like to do, of course, but it’s too late. I’m content to leave them undone,” he said.

Goodall’s last meal was fish and chips, Reuters reports, but the scientist said he hasn’t been able to truly enjoy his meals like he used to.

Colton Haynes and Jeff Leatham have ended their relationship after six months of marriage, US Weekly and TMZ reported Friday.

It’s not clear whether they plan to file for divorce.

Haynes posted a cryptic music video to his social media accounts Thursday that some people are interpreting as a reference to the split.

“I don’t like when you’re staying out all night and never answer your phone, I follow you around the world just to be left alone, and man, it sucks,” the “Teen Wolf” star sings in the video, which can be viewed below. “I said I loved you despite the cheating drama. ... Maybe in the future, you’ll come around.”

A representative for Haynes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Leatham, who works as an artistic director for Four Seasons Hotels, hasn’t been featured on Haynes’ Instagram for a while. The last photo of the couple to appear on the actor’s account is dated Jan. In compliance with Swiss law, he turned a wheel to release a fatal dose of the drug himself.

His last words, as the infusion started to drip, were, “This is taking an awfully long time!”

He fell asleep within a few minutes and died at about 12:30 p.m. local time, just as the music for “Ode to Joy” concluded, according to Exit International. Some of his grandchildren attended the final appointment with him.

Goodall asked not to have a funeral or remembrance service. He wanted his body to be donated to science or for his ashes to be sprinkled. He did not believe in an afterlife, the organization said.

He told reporters he hoped sharing his story would “increase the pressure” on Australia to change its laws about assisted suicide.
