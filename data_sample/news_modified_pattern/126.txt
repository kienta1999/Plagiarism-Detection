Comedian Michelle Wolf remains totally unbowed by the backlash to her White House Correspondents’ Association dinner set.

So much so that on Wednesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” Wolf threw out some more gags about White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

“It went great, and every single person loved it,” Wolf joked to Meyers about her performance at the April 28 event. “Actually, Sarah Huckabee Sanders called me and she was like, ‘I loved it so much. “I wouldn’t do it. What does he need it for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians.”

Lawmakers have also raised questions about Jackson’s lack of managerial experience and have blamed the White House for poor vetting of top officials.

“It’s really frustrating to me that this administration continues to not vet or sloppily send over a nominee that leaves us having to really vet them and look at serious questions,” committee member Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told reporters.Folks online called out President Donald Trump over his contempt for the environment after he took part in a tree-planting ceremony outside the White House on Monday.

Trump joined his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to symbolically shovel dirt around a young European sessile oak, which Macron brought as a gift to Trump during his state visit to the U.S. I got every joke.’”

Meyers feigned surprise, and Wolf, who used to work on “Late Night,” replied with a turn of phrase recently used by Sanders herself: “Well, you know, you give the best information you have at the time.”

Wolf caused controversy at the dinner for saying Sanders “burned facts” to create the “perfect smokey eye.” Critics interpreted the line as an attack on Sanders’ physical appearance, but Wolf later insisted it was solely “about her despicable behavior.

For the 2018 enrollment period, the Trump administration went much further. The advertising budget saw a 90 percent decrease, and programs that fund counselors who help consumers shop for insurance were cut by 40 percent.

Trump cut of billions of dollars in repayments owed to health insurers serving the poorest Obamacare enrollees.”

Last Monday, Sessions referred another case to himself. This time, he didn’t ask for briefs to make a decision later ― he scrapped a prior decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals holding that applicants for asylum have the right to a full hearing before a judge. Supporters of the board’s decision argue it is important for immigrants to get a chance to explain their asylum request rather than being rejected based on an application they may have filled out with no legal representation or understanding of what is relevant based on complex asylum law.

““Even apart from Jeff Sessions, I’ve never liked the idea that the attorney general can review a decision of the BIA [Board of Immigration Appeals] at all."” - Stephen Legomsky, a former lead counsel for U.D.” were on the case after Wednesday’s season finale made a bold move on the fate of Alvin Olinsky, the detective played by Elias Koteas for the past five seasons.

Olinsky’s future was already looking precarious in the previous episode. After landing behind bars on an unjust murder charge, he was stabbed.

Olinsky died early on Wednesday’s finale, giving viewers plenty of time to sound off on social media.

No words except thank you #eliaskoteas for one of the most beloved, most original characters ever to hit my screen. @NBCChicagoPD I’m not sure I’ll recover 😭😭😭. #RIPOlinsky #chicagopdfinale pic. “At the end of the day, we need to connect the dots. The NRA needs to step up to the plate and show leadership. Elected officials are receiving dollars from the NRA, and they’re afraid to set policy and to set necessary gun rules.”

Executive producer Rick Eid explained to Entertainment Weekly why the show killed off good ol’ Al. “From a dramatic point of view, we all thought it was really interesting,” he said.

One Twitter user urged the show to somehow rescind Olinsky’s ascendance to TV detective heaven.

Ok. Enough! Find a way to raise Al from the dead!!! Love #EliasKoteas — Angela Harrison (@Angela_s_harris) May 10, 2018Hopefully they learned their lesson. out of the Paris agreement on combating climate change.

He later added: “All nations agree except one, and that is solely because of one man: our current president.”

Brown has volunteered himself as an unofficial ambassador abroad on climate change issues and was one of the first three governors to join the U.
