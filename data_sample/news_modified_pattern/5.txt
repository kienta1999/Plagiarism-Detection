WASHINGTON ― Top congressional lawmakers and a White House attorney met with Justice Department officials on Thursday to discuss classified information about an FBI informant involved in the investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats have denounced the sit-down as inappropriate and contrary to the rule of law.

Republicans had requested the information for weeks, issuing a subpoena and warning top DOJ officials that if they refused they would hold them contempt of Congress.

Emmet Flood, the White House attorney dealing with the Russia investigation, attended part of the classified briefing and was spotted leaving the DOJ headquarters alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S. You thought that this is going to be a struggle forever.C.), and White House chief of staff John Kelly. None of the men took questions from a contingent of reporters standing watch. His more than eight-month detention stemmed from two offenses that were each punishable by up to 30 days in jail, she noted, meaning he has already been detained “over four times longer than the maximum sentence he faced for his underlying offenses.”

The court did not create a definitive standard for when the government must provide a bond hearing.

Now Sajous’ case — or a similar one, if the Department of Justice doesn’t appeal — is likely to work its way up through the courts. That means the Supreme Court will likely be forced to weigh in on the question it avoided answering in February.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling or whether it plans to appeal.

Sajous, who has lived in the U.S. on a green card since age 14 and has raised a family here, could be out of detention by early June. Although he is a legal permanent resident, Sajous, who has had depression and been homeless in recent years, is subject to deportation because of two misdemeanor convictions from 2015 for bending fare cards to use the New York subway without paying. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in September, and he has remained in detention since.

The White House later said in a statement that Kelly and Flood made brief remarks at the beginning of the meeting to “relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible” and departed before it actually began.

The unusual meeting had become highly politicized in recent days as President Donald Trump, a possible subject of the probe, ratcheted up attacks against the investigation, the Justice Department and the FBI. He has claimed that the FBI had “infiltrated” and “spied” on his 2016 presidential campaign when the agency reportedly used an informant to make contact with Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.

The president demanded the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.

White House involvement in an investigation Justice Department investigation is rare. Trump has routinely broken norms about how the White House interacts with the Justice Department, which is supposed to have a degree of independence. While the presidency can certainly shape the direction of the Justice Department through nominations and help broadly outline priorities, the White House is not supposed to be involved in individual cases.

Typically, administrations are eager to steer clear of any actions which might give an appearance of politicization of the Justice Department.com/z7b105Lc1b — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 21, 2018

An emotional Kelly Clarkson ignored a traditional moment of silence for victims and instead demanded action to honor the victims of the Santa Fe High School shooting at the Billboard Music Awards Sunday.

“They wanted me to do a moment of silence. I’m so sick of moments of silence,” said Clarkson, her voice breaking, in the cold open of the awards ceremony. “It’s not working. Like, obviously. So why don’t we not do a moment of silence? Why don’t we do a moment of action, why don’t we do a moment of change? Why don’t we change what’s happening? Because it’s horrible,” she added to huge applause from the audience.

She pointed out she’s a Texas girl, and mom of four children. “Once again, y’all, we’re grieving for more kids that have died for just an absolute no reason at all,” she said.

“Mamas and daddies should be able to send their kids to school, to church, to movie theaters, to clubs — you should be able to live your life without that kind of fear. We need to do better.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, said the meeting on the classified information had not changed his view that the FBI followed proper procedures during their investigation.

“Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures or protocols,” Schiff told reporters after the meeting.

Justice Department officials initially invited only Nunes and committee member Gowdy to review the classified information regarding the FBI informant and the agency’s purported monitoring of Trump campaign officials. Democrats immediately criticized the move, accusing the GOP of politicizing intelligence by initially excluding Democrats from the classified briefing.

“Never has there been anything so disrespectful of the Congress than what they’re doing today,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday. The California Democrat said she had directed Schiff to attend in her place so as to make sure “henchmen of the president” do not interfere with the investigation. Before that, every time she needed anything ― diapers, milk, gas for the car ― she had to ask for cash.

Amanda said she often felt depressed. Every so often, she said, she would tell Justin she wasn’t happy and he’d beg her to stay, saying he couldn’t live without her.

She said he also threatened that if she did leave, she’d lose the kids.

“It’s not a huge surprise to me that there wasn’t a lot of physical violence, because it wasn’t necessary,” said Donna Bloom, director of legal services at Denton County Friends of the Family and one of the advocates who stayed with Amanda in the days after the shooting. Physical violence, she said, is just one of many tools people use to control their partners.

“Amanda is a pretty compliant person, so it didn’t have to escalate to physical violence,” Bloom said. “He could use these other tools to achieve the same objective, which is to be in control.”

Last year, Amanda finally decided to leave Justin.

Justice Department officials also briefed other members of Congress ― the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” composed of congressional leaders and the top members of the intelligence committees from both parties― on Thursday afternoon.”One of the 700 movies and TV shows that Netflix still has in its pipeline includes a modern retelling of The Hunchback of Notre Dame from Idris Elba.

The “Avengers: Infinity War” actor will star, direct and produce the movie for the streaming service, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Based on a script by Michael Mitnick, the film is being described as “sonic and musical experience” and will feature an original score.

Victor Hugo’s classic French novel has seen many screen adaptations, but none more popular than Disney’s 1996 animated film. A darker entry in the Disney canon, the film introduced the story of Quasimodo, a hunchbacked bell-ringer, who falls in love with the gypsy Esmeralda to a whole new generation.

Elba has struck gold with Netflix before, earning critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for his role in “Beasts of No Nation.” He’s also set to star and executive produce the upcoming comedy “Turn Up Charlie” about a struggling DJ.

The “Luther” actor has stepped behind the camera before, making his feature directorial debut earlier this year with “Yardie,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

And while he has received more attention for his filmmaking, Elba is also a rapper and DJ, most recently making an appearance on Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ album “This Unruly Mess I’ve Made.”Church leaders Joshua Wright, Donald Jackson and William Wright have been charged with child abuse and other sex offenses. Kelly and Flood made similar remarks in that meeting as well before departing shortly after they began.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, later criticized their presence at the latter meeting.
