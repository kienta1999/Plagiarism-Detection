OMFG. Kind of like hugely embracing it, sitting and thinking. Because I do believe that some of it you should embrace. If you’re going to be lazy, you should be properly lazy and not feel guilty about it. Enjoy and embrace, make the most of laziness, because as a creative person, laziness is a great opportunity and a great gift because it loosens the fluidity of your mind. ASIAN LEADS. ASIAN INDEPENDENT WOMEN JUST TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL. ASIAN SEXUALIZED HUNKS. ASIAN FAMILIES. ASIAN VILLAINS. ASIAN BEST FRIEND WHO SAYS "GURL, YOU GO THIS. ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images

The CFDA announcement points to the reality TV star’s “200 million followers across her social media channels” and states that “she was one of the first to monetize her digital platforms and create a two-way dialogue with her followers.”

CFDA board member and designer Tommy Hilfiger called Kardashian the “most important and powerful influencer in the world” in the council’s statement.

“Her reach extends far beyond her own brands,” he said. “Every time she wears, posts or talks about a fashion brand, there is an immediate and significant increase in both awareness and sales.”

Steven Kolb, the CFDA’s president and chief executive officer, told Women’s Wear Daily that Hilfiger came up with the idea for the special honor.

“Tommy Hilfiger said, ‘If you think about influencers and how they’ve changed our industry, I think we should acknowledge that,’” Kolb explained. “[The board] all agreed that Kim was someone who has really impacted the industry and has changed the way brands are presented. She’s a friend of a lot of the designers and has had great influence on fashion globally.”

OMG OMG OMG 😍😍😍 https://t.co/fU0JoMYju9 — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 9, 2018An internal investigation by NBC Universal concluded that sexual misconduct accusations made by four women against former “Today” show host Matt Lauer are credible, according to a report released Wednesday. “We’re doing the best we can with what we have.

The probe found no culture of sexual harassment in NBC’s news division, now that Lauer is gone. Yet the company acknowledged there is work to do. Many staffers told investigators they did not feel comfortable reporting incidents of harassment or misconduct to management for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation.

“That is not acceptable,” NBC News President Andy Lack said in an email to staff, provided to HuffPost. “We cannot change the past. What we can do is learn from it, and try to make it right.”

Investigators interviewed 68 people, including current and former “Today” show staffers, hosted more than 30 focus groups with 262 staffers, and reviewed emails and texts from Lauer and NBC leaders.

The network has been bluntly criticized, however, by advocates who say its investigation should have been conducted by an independent third party.

The seven-page report was released about five months after Lauer’s Nov. 28 ouster from the show where he spent two decades as a star reporter.

NBC said no complaints about Lauer were made to anyone in a position of authority prior to late November, when the first of several accusers alerted the company’s human resources department to the anchor’s misconduct. One incident subsequently uncovered ― in which Lauer put his hand on a colleague’s thigh and made a sexual comment ― dated back to 1996.

“A number of individuals interviewed said that Lauer could be flirtatious, would frequently make jokes, some with sexual overtones, and would openly engage in sexually-oriented banter in the workplace,” the report said.

NBC noted that two of Lauer’s four accusers said they believed the network’s leadership “knew or must have known” about their star anchor’s misconduct. But executives who were questioned denied any knowledge, and investigators said they were “unable to otherwise substantiate” the allegations.

The report countered a claim by former “Today” anchor Ann Curry, who told The Washington Post she had told management about Lauer’s behavior in 2012. NBC said Curry “did not disclose to anyone in management that she had received a specific complaint.” She refused to reveal any names, according to NBC.0 season. Jason sends Molly [Malaney] home before his proposal [to Melissa Rycroft], and is so distraught that it’s hard to imagine how he could have gotten himself back together enough to propose to someone else that same day.

Emma Gray: He’s sobbing over a balcony.

Claire: Arie sends Lauren home, and I see NO emotion. That was surprising to me. I thought we were going to see a little Mesnick, a little tear ― the most distraught we see him is when she’s giving her pre-proposal to him, talking about how he’s the only man in the world for her, he sort of grimaces and shakes his head. That is the most emotion we see from him.

Jacqueline Trumbull: He’s an emotional person, too. He was very emotional during our breakup.

Emma: That’s why I’m very confused! We almost saw more emotion from him during that breakup than anything last night.

Claire: And Lauren seemed quite emotional, but in a very restrained way. She was crying, but not sobbing. She doesn’t yell at him. She says she’s very confused.

But on Wednesday, Curry told The New York Times she did not participate in “any formal investigation.” The anchor, who was pushed out of NBC in 2012 after clashing with Lauer, said she received a short phone call from a network lawyer who asked only about the comments she made to the Post.

Curry told the Times she believes there is a culture of “pervasive verbal sexual harassment” at NBC.

In its report, the network also paused to address Lauer’s now-infamous “button,” a device under his desk that allowed him to close his office door without standing up. To critics, the button seemed an alarmingly useful tool for predatory behavior, but NBC said it is “a commonly available feature in executive offices” and does not lock the door from the inside.

Longtime rumors about Lauer’s behavior became public knowledge during the wave of Me Too accusations against powerful men late last year.

His first accuser, an unnamed former NBC staffer, said in late November the anchor sexually assaulted her at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Five days passed between the time she alerted HR and the time company representatives interviewed her. When management later spoke to Lauer, he admitted to “engaging in sexual activity” with the woman.

In a move that shocked “Today” co-anchors and many fans, Lauer was promptly fired.

Investigators spoke to three other accusers about alleged incidents in 2000, 2001 and 2007, but did not disclose their nature or the names of the women.

A scathing Variety report last year laid out accusations against Lauer that ranged from gifting sex toys to exposing his penis. One woman, former NBC production assistant Addie Collins, said she had a month-long affair with the anchor.

Lauer said in his public apology he was sorry for the people he hurt. He claimed that some of the allegations against him were untrue, but added “there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.”

In his memo to NBC staff, Lack outlined several steps to improve workplace culture at NBC News, including the ability to report incidents to an external law firm.

The company said it remains interested in hearing from other women who experienced sexual misconduct by Lauer, concluding: “It’s possible that new information could surface that could change the factual findings of our investigation and our conclusions.

At the press conference, Orlando Police Chief John Mina announced that a detective had been assigned to “focus exclusively” on the case. He also unveiled a city bus with Jennifer Kesse’s photo on it and said the department was having Jennifer’s face displayed on 18 digital billboards throughout the region.

Jennifer’s brother, Logan Kesse, was visibly angry – the police chief’s words, in his mind, sowing the seeds of discontent. By the time it was over, those seeds had fully germinated.”
