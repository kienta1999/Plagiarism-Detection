A lounging kangaroo has been causing quite a stir on social media for its, uh, sexiness.

The park and kangaroo experts have not immediately responded to HuffPost requests for comments on the kangaroo’s well-being.

It’s not clear whether the photo was staged, but HuffPost has reached out to Duniau for more information on the story behind it. She did not immediately respond.

“The experience taught me so much. I learned how to be resourceful and calm under pressure. I was able to bond one on one with my son from his first breaths,” she said.A natural cloud of suspicion surrounds the act of selling a used car. Like, if it’s so great and dependable, why are you getting rid of it?

However, for one guy on Craigslist, selling his silver 1999 Toyota Corolla was all about lifting that cloud with brutal, unadulterated honesty. https://t. policy, calling the American support for the Saudi-UAE coalition “very modest” and noting U.S.co/p2eZfMDF5N — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) March 13, 2018

Cheney responded to McCain by defending the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation” and saying it had “saved lives, prevented attacks.”

Trumpet player James Frost-Winn, who played in Tinsley’s band Crystal Garden in 2015 and 2016, filed a lawsuit in Washington state on Thursday.

He is accusing Tinsley, 54, of “sexually flirting with verbal sexual comments, physically touching [and] sexting,” “sexually predatory harassment” and “creepy, sex-based behavior” during his time in the band, according to the website Consequence of Sound.

Frost-Winn is seeking $9 million in damages against Tinsley, saying the alleged advances created a “hostile work environment,” according to court documents obtained by USA Today.

As a result, Frost-Winn says, he experienced “loss of enjoyment of life, pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation.”

Frost-Winn said he met Tinsley when he was homeless and busking in San Francisco. The two became friends, and hung out whenever Tinsley was in town. And after reading his hilarious ad, we’ll be damned if you won’t want to at least take it for a test drive.

The ad has since been removed from the site, probably for being too real, but one Twitter user was nice enough to preserve it for posterity.

Regardless of where or how it came to be, the photo is causing a ruckus on Twitter:

‘dayum’ that’s a sexy kangaroo?? — Luke Cutforth 🌊✨ (@LukeIsNotSexy) January 11, 2018Tuomas Kurtakko/ Lapland Hotel SnowVillage A White Walker sculpted out of ice looks down at a hotel bed inside the Lapland Hotels SnowVillage.

A Finnish hotel chain has created a stunning winter retreat that’s perfect for diehard “Game of Thrones” fans ― if they’re brave enough to go ranging that far north, at least.

Lapland Hotels has teamed up with HBO Nordic to create a “Game of Thrones”-themed hotel sculpted out of snow and ice. Each room features an ice sculpture: There’s a ferocious white walker with glowing blue eyes, an icy replication of Braavos’ Hall of Faces and a life-size iron throne.

Inside temperatures can dip to 23 degrees Fahrenheit, so the hotel recommends only staying for one night ― even though overnight guests are given thermal sleeping bags to help them stay warm.

The hotel has 10 overnight rooms that start at $200. It’s part of a larger attraction that includes a movie theater, a chapel, and restaurant and bar carved out of ice. The SnowVillage is set to be open until April 30.

The disaster took place in the same community where just weeks ago firefighters confronted the largest wildfire in the state’s history. The back-to-back disasters ― fire and flooding ― may seem like a cruel irony, but they’re directly related.

A number of factors have played a role in how destructive and how lethal the mudslides turned out to be.

Some Santa Barbara and Ventura county residents who had just returned to their homes after evacuating in December from the Thomas fire were reluctant to pack up and go again when they received a flood warning. Some lost their homes, others their lives, as a result.

Local officials released numerous warnings in the early days of January as heavy rainfall was forecast, but they chose not to send out emergency alerts to cellphones until after the flooding had begun. They worried that the disaster-fatigued residents might not take an alert seriously, and didn’t want to be seen as “crying wolf.”

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said there “isn’t an exact science” for predicting the scope of a disaster.

“Obviously, a lot depends on Mother Nature, on the magnitude of the rainfall, the magnitude of the mudslides and so forth,” the sheriff told reporters on Tuesday.

But given the torrential rains that were predicted, a devastating disaster was almost inevitable. It’s no secret that drought, wildfires and mudslides ― all three of which California has witnessed of late ― are connected.

The state just emerged from a five-year drought emergency, which Gov. Jerry Brown declared officially over in April of 2017. The long drought period, which experts say is among the extreme weather patterns exacerbated by climate change, made the land especially fire-prone. Not surprisingly, 2017 saw the largest and deadliest wildfires in California’s history.

The Thomas fire burned through over 280,000 acres in Southern California in December, leaving the land scorched and flood-prone. Vegetation whose root systems might have held back the mudflow was destroyed, and the stage was set for deadly and fast-moving mudslides as Southern California was deluged with heavy rainfall.

Aware of these environmental trends, officials warned about the potential of mudslides on local government websites and social media, as well as in news outlets and community emails.

Jeff Gater, Santa Barbara County’s emergency manager, told The Los Angeles Times that over 200,000 emails warning of the possible disaster were delivered to residents who had signed up for such messages.

But when it came to deciding whether or not to use a push alert system ― the same one used to sent out Amber Alerts for missing children ― county officials initially opted not to.

The state’s emergency alert protocol has been under scrutiny since the October wildfire disaster in Northern California, which left more than 40 people dead. Officials in Sonoma County — where over half of the fatalities occurred — had decided not to deploy the federal Wireless Emergency Alert system, and some survivors of the 21 blazes later said they were inadequately warned.

When wildfires flared in Southern California, state officials acted fast to send alerts to some 8 million smartphones in the area. But Gater said that an alert system shouldn’t be overused.

“If you tell everyone to get out ...President Donald Trump’s ill-timed boasts about the U.S. economy provided comic fodder for Stephen Colbert on Monday’s “Late Show.”

The comedian noted how Trump had bragged during an earlier speech in Cincinnati about the booming state of the economy. But on the same day, the stock market (which Trump repeatedly takes credit for when it surges) was taking a huge tumble.

“Remember when Donald Trump told us we’d be tired of winning?” asked Colbert. “Well, evidently the stock market is exhausted. the next time people won’t listen,” he said. “If you cry wolf, people stop listening.”

The alert was ultimately sent out at roughly 4 a.m. local time, the L.A. Times reported, when the flooding had already began and it was clear the situation was only going to get worse.

Meanwhile, Brown said sheriff’s deputies had knocked on 7,000 doors in the mandatory evacuation area ― mostly in and around Montecito ― telling residents to leave their homes. Not all of them heeded the warning.

“There was evacuation fatigue from the fire,” local resident Marco Farrell told the Associated Press.

Farrell and his parents had evacuated for more than a week during the fire, and decided not to leave again when a voluntary evacuation notice was issued for their neighborhood. In retrospect, he told AP, he wished they had.

The mud flow burst into their home and sent a boulder plowing through the kitchen door. Thankfully, Farrell and his parents were able to escape. Just weeks before Trump’s 2016 presidential victory, adult film actress and director Jessica Drake came forward with allegations that at the event, Trump grabbed her, kissed her and offered her $10,000 for sex.

Drake is one of more than 20 women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse over several decades. He has repeatedly denied all of the allegations.

Clifford told In Touch that at the end of her evening with Trump, he promised to cast her as a contestant on his NBC reality show “The Apprentice.”

“He goes, ‘People would think you’re just this idiot with blond hair and big boobs. You would be perfect for it because you’re such a smart businesswoman,’” she recalled that Trump said.

“He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with, beautiful and smart just like his daughter.” - Stephanie Clifford, as quoted in a 2011 interview

He used the promise of casting her as a reason to keep in touch for the next year, according to the interview, and called her from a blocked number “about every 10 days” or whenever he “saw or read about me somewhere.” Her ex-husband, Michael Mosny, corroborated her claims that she and Trump frequently spoke.

At one point in their relationship, In Touch quotes her as saying, Trump even compared her to his daughter (presumably Ivanka, since the president’s other daughter, Tiffany, was a child at the time).
