OMG OMGGGGG IM SO EXCITED TONIGHT WHAT #EndGameMusicVideo — Jane🐍💕 (@getaylorcat13) January 11, 2018Another troubling claim has been lodged against Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens by the ex-husband of the woman with whom he politician admitted to having an affair.

The ex-husband said Greitens slapped his ex-wife after she told him she and her then-husband had sex, the anonymous man says through his attorney, Albert Watkins. HuffPost confirmed the claim, first detailed in Talking Points Memo, with Watkins. The woman involved in the affair has not been named. She used to be Greitens’ hairdresser.

What’s the point?

The point of a military parade would be to “honor our service members,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters Thursday. But when HuffPost asked veterans if they felt honored by the idea of a military parade, the response was mostly a collective eye roll.

“The only people that like this stuff are the VIPs,” said one 20-year veteran of the Army who requested anonymity because he still works for the military.

“Everybody hates life preparing and executing these dog-and-pony shows,” he added, using a term that two other veterans used to describe the parade.

Several veterans bristled at the idea that the U.S. needed to show off its military prowess in a big parade. “We demonstrate our military strength in joint military exercises that we do pretty much all the time all over the world,” Jonathan said.

“The U.S.

Her ex-husband provided a recording to local CBS affiliate KMOV earlier this week containing other shocking accusations allegedly made by his ex-wife: that Greitens taped the woman’s hands together while she was nude and blindfolded her before taking a photograph he threatened to use as blackmail if she ever disclosed the relationship.

Greitens is married with two children. The affair allegedly took place in 2015.

Although the governor admitted late Wednesday to being “unfaithful” in his marriage, he strongly denied any accusation of violence or blackmail through his attorney, James Bennett. Greitens also claims the photograph does not exist, and denies the quote attributed to him on the recording.

According to the woman involved in the affair, whose voice is allegedly heard on the tape, Greitens said after taking the compromising photo, “You’re never going to mention my name, otherwise there will be pictures of [you] everywhere.”

“Any allegation of violence is completely false. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories … stories that just aren’t true, without checking facts first,” the statement on fake news read, in part. “Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control ‘exactly what people think.’ ... This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.”

About a quarter of Americans, including a slim majority of those aware that they live in an area with a Sinclair station, said they recall hearing the statement about fake news.

The content of the statement itself caused less consternation with the public, many of whom have little trust in the news media: 48 percent of the public said they approve of the message, while just 27 percent disapprove.

Nearly 80 percent of voters who backed Trump in the 2016 election said they approve of the statement, compared with 43 percent of non-voters and 27 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton. Clinton voters were also 50 points likelier than Trump voters to hold an unfavorable view of Sinclair.

Other questions showed less stark political divides. It never happened,” Bennett said in a statement on the governor’s behalf.

“There was never any violence,” he said. “Anything reported otherwise is untrue and we will explore pursuing all legal action. This was a consensual relationship that lasted multiple months and was years ago before Eric was elected governor.”

Dent, one of a growing number of Republicans not seeking re-election in November, said the coming midterm vote will be a referendum on Trump and his conduct as president.

“These issues will have an impact,” he warned.T.J. White before his hair was cut. In September, Trump hosted a dinner with “grassroots leaders,” including evangelical heavyweights such as Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Nance, Faith & Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and Tim Goeglein, a vice president at Focus on the Family. In a photo posted to the White House website, Pruitt appears at the table opposite Trump, the only Cabinet secretary in attendance, though his name is not listed in the caption.

As Pruitt’s scandals mount, Christian groups have rallied to defend him. On April 6, the Conservative Action Project published an open letter calling for Pruitt’s “continued tenure at the EPA” and thanking him “for the significant actions he has taken to implement President Trump’s deregulatory agenda.” The list of 186 signatories included Christians for a Sustainable Economy Executive Director David Kullberg, Christian educator Lisa Calvert and Faith Wins President Chad Connelly. Some of the religiously affiliated signatories, such as Anne Schlafly Cori, chair of the “pro-family” Eagle Forum, have a history of backing climate change denial efforts, according to research compiled by the nonpartisan Climate Investigations Center.

White evangelical Christians, more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in 2016, are the least likely of any religious group in the U.S. to understand the science behind climate change, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believed the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, compared to 41 percent of white mainline Protestants and 56 percent of black Protestants. About 37 percent of white evangelicals don’t believe the climate is changing at all.

In 2005, the National Association of Evangelicals was on the cusp of affirming climate science in a new national platform called “For the Health of a Nation. Courtesy of Lattrice Averette

UPDATE: April 2 ― The Jones County School District superintendent said the school investigated the claims and could not find any evidence of the allegations.

Jones County School District Superintendent Tommy Parker told WDAM TV that it appears the incident was fabricated.”

Greitens was elected governor in November 2016.

In a follow-up statement, Bennett called the Talking Points Memo report a “political hit piece” because it cites Roy Temple, former chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, as one of two sources for the ex-husband’s slapping claim. The other source is the ex-husband’s lawyer, who is not mentioned in Bennett’s statement.

The new figures, which reflect the first two quarters of the 2018 fiscal year, demonstrate that ICE is carrying out the crackdown on unauthorized immigrants that President Donald Trump promised. That means ICE officers are picking up more people with clean records, even if they were previously allowed to remain in the country.

“If somebody has violated our immigration laws, they are priorities now,” Corey Price, the assistant director for enforcement at ICE, told reporters on a conference call, adding that in the final years of Barack Obama’s administration, the agency’s “scope was significantly narrowed.

St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner on Thursday announced plans for a formal investigation into the allegations against Greitens. A bipartisan group of Missouri state senators also asked the state’s attorney general to investigate the governor.

Greitens and his wife, Sheena, issued a joint statement on Wednesday acknowledging the affair.

“A few years ago, before Eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage,” the statement read. “This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately. While we never would have wished for this pain in our marriage, or the pain that this has caused others, with God’s mercy Sheena has forgiven and we have emerged stronger.”
