The governing body of the United States’ Olympic teams ignored dozens of athletes’ sexual misconduct complaints against two taekwondo champions for years, according to a new lawsuit.

The U.S. Olympic Committee, as well as USA Taekwondo, turned a blind eye to decades of alleged sexual abuse by brothers Steven and Jean Lopez, two of the sport’s most high-profile figures, contends a lawsuit filed Friday by four named women, as well as 44 women who have yet to be identified.

The lawsuit accuses USOC, USA Taekwondo and the Lopez brothers of knowingly participating in human trafficking. The organizations were aware of the numerous sexual abuse complaints since 1996 but continued to allow the brothers to travel and interact with young female athletes, the plaintiffs contend.

“The USOC is deeply focused on supporting, protecting and empowering the athletes we serve,” Patrick Sandusky, chief external affairs officer for the Olympic Committee, told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.

“We are aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety, and prevent and respond to abuse,” Sandusky continued. “The launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, along with a number of additional significant actions we are taking, will ensure that our athletes are better protected from these heinous acts.”

“While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters.” - Statement from USA Taekwondo

USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez, 44, was banned from the sport last month following accusations that he sexually assaulted four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997. A gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and injured over a dozen others, reigniting a fierce debate on gun control around the country.

A number of companies, ranging from banks to insurance providers to rental car brands, announced decisions to end formal and informal deals with the NRA in response to the company’s staunch anti-gun control stance.

Cagle, however, saw Delta’s decision as a direct attack on conservatives and vowed to undermine any legislation that might benefit the airlines.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Cagle wrote on Twitter on Monday.

I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back. A report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport concluded Lopez had engaged in a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct” and allegedly used his authority as a coach to “groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes.”

Jean’s younger brother, 39-year-old Steven Lopez, was temporarily suspended from the sport on Monday pending an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. Steven Lopez, a two-time Olympic champion, is one of USA Taekwondo’s most decorated athletes.

USA Taekwondo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed Steven Lopez’s suspension.

“While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters,” a representative for USA Taekwondo told HuffPost in a statement.

“We will resolutely enforce this immediate suspension and any other sanction imposed by the Center,” according to the statement. “We note that this is an important part of providing a safe and nurturing environment for our athletes. Today’s decision is another example of the progress that is clearly being made in this area.”It’s really never a question of whether Blake Lively will slay the red carpet, but rather how she will, as the actress has set a sterling track record for turning looks on the regular.

The “Simple Favor” star went above and beyond Monday night at the Met Gala, where she nailed the theme, “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” and then some.

Lively stunned in a beaded ruby red custom Versace gown and $2 million worth of Lorraine Schwartz jewelry decorating her body, including a halo. In fact, the dress was so grand it couldn’t even fit in a regular-sized vehicle ― have you seen that train? ― so she took a party bus to the event instead.

Instead of walking the museum’s famous steps with her husband Ryan Reynolds like last year, however, Lively was accompanied at the gala by shoe designer Christian Louboutin and “The Handmaids Tale” director Reed Morano.

But leave it to Lively to keep her famous family close, even while Reynolds tours the world promoting his new superhero flick, “Deadpool 2.” The actress accessorized her look with a custom-made bedazzled Judith Leiber clutch with the names of each member of the Reynolds-Lively family.

In the photo below, you can see the R. Reynolds detail, but the clutch also bears the first initial of their children’s names ― Ines, 1, and James, 3 ― as well Lively’s own, she revealed on Vogue’s Instagram stories.

“This year’s may be my favorite dress ever,” she told the outlet earlier this month about her Met Gala look. However, outside of schools, an average of 1,480 students are murdered annually. In other words, students are 67 times more likely to be murdered outside of school than at school.

There is understandable public alarm that there have been approximately 300 school shootings since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. However, according to CDC reports, there have been over 500,000 shootings outside of schools in those five years, or about 275 shootings every day, resulting in approximately 92 deaths and 183 injuries.

Security Council fails to act on Syria, Washington “remains prepared to act if we must,” just as it did last year when it bombed a Syrian government air base over a deadly chemical weapons attack.

“It is not the path we prefer, but it is a path we have demonstrated we will take, and we are prepared to take again,” Haley told the 15-member Security Council. “When the international community consistently fails to act, there are times when states are compelled to take their own action.”

Haley’s warning came as the United States asked the Security Council to demand an immediate 30-day ceasefire in Damascus and rebel-held eastern Ghouta, where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, backed by Russia and Iran, say they are targeting “terrorist” groups which are shelling the capital.
