WASHINGTON ― Supreme Court justices appeared divided on Wednesday over whether an Ohio process for removing people from the voter rolls was a violation of federal law.

In Ohio, if someone doesn’t vote for two years, they receive a notice in the mail confirming their address. If they fail to respond to the notice, and fail to vote for an additional four years, they get removed from the voter rolls.

The plaintiffs in the case allege the process violates a provision in federal law that bars states from removing people from the rolls simply because they don’t vote.

Twitter user Margaret Lyons tweeted out a photo of Kimchee the Maltipoo, an adorable dog with over 6,300 Instagram followers.

People couldn’t believe the dog’s likeness to Dern:

Dern had a great sense of humor about her doggie doppelgänger and shared the photo with followers on her Twitter account.

“Should she have played Renata in Big Little Lies?!” the actress jokingly tweeted. States are required under federal law however, to make a reasonable effort to clean their voter rolls.

Eric Murphy, the Ohio solicitor general, faced sharp questions on Wednesday from Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor over the process.

Sotomayor pressed Murphy on the consequences the Ohio process would have, particularly on poor and minority populations. She questioned whether failing to respond to a notice and not voting from the state was really enough evidence to indicate a voter had moved and might be ineligible. She noted that in Ohio there are large groups of minorities and homeless people who face obstacles to voting like long lines at the polls. She asked Murphy how the state could begin a “process of disenfranchisement” without reasonable evidence someone had moved.

But Murphy said the state didn’t need to have precise evidence because it only was required to make a “reasonable effort” under federal law. “His misogyny runs deep.”

In case you’re interested. Here’s the longer 11 min video of Tony Robbins talking about the @MeTooMVMT: 😐https://t.co/69MnzK7lHh — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) April 7, 2018

Robbins, a wildly popular motivational speaker, attempted to clarify his comments in a statement Sunday, calling the Me Too movement a “beautiful force for good. Whether or not adults can forgive the capricious plot, Paco Delgado’s decadent costumes and Naomi Shohan’s vibrant production design are likely to enrapture the target audience. This is is a kids movie through and through, and I’d gladly take into account youngsters’ less cynical reviews when reconsidering “Wrinkle” down the line.

The thing is, kids movies needn’t be juvenile. That’s why we still talk about the intelligent world-building of “Harry Potter” and “The Wizard of Oz,” where social hierarchies and centralized governments are essential to the makeup. “A Wrinkle in Time” probably shares more DNA with “The NeverEnding Story” and “Mary Poppins,” but even those transposed real-world dynamics onto quixotic whimsy.”

“My comments failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has achieved,” Robbins said in the statement. “I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.”

“It is clear that I still have much to learn,” he added.

A video of Robbins controversial remarks went viral after Burke weighed in on them Saturday. In the video, a woman identified as Nanine McCool is seen confronting Robbins over his stance on the Me Too movement.

“I think you misunderstand the Me Too movement. I think ―” McCool says before Robbins cuts her off.

“I’m not mocking the Me Too movement. I’m mocking victimhood,” Robins said.

Ohio’s process was clearly permissible under two federal laws, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA), Murphy said. Both laws make it clear someone can’t be removed from the rolls for not voting, but do allow states to take a history of not voting in federal elections into account when they remove people.

The central question in the Ohio case is whether sending the initial mailing to people who don’t vote and then removing them if they fail to respond and then don’t vote for four more years amounts to removing people because they don’t vote.

Justice Stephen Breyer seemed sympathetic to the state’s need to maintain accurate rolls, pressing Paul Smith, the lawyer for the plaintiffs challenging the Ohio law, on what processes states could use to reasonably identify people who had moved. He asked Smith how the state of Rhode Island, for example, could know if one of its eligible voters had moved to Tasmania and died there. Department of Commerce, which the National Weather Service is part of, were intent on firing Chen regardless of what facts arose. They were “more concerned about being right than doing the right thing. Based on the unyielding nature of their testimony, I would not have been surprised if they rejected that 2 + 2 = 4,” the judge wrote.

Officials failed to consider a dozen sworn declarations from Chen’s co-workers in their termination decision, Schroder added. Ultimately, the National Weather Service failed to prove the “vast majority” of Chen’s alleged conduct, she said, and the Commerce Department didn’t have cause to terminate Chen.

“It’s clear that Sherry Chen was the victim of gross injustice and unwarranted racial profiling during her time at the [Commerce] Department.” - Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.)

The judge swapped Chen’s termination for a 15-day suspension without pay, due to what Schroeder called a “singular lapse of judgment on Ms. Chen’s part.” This referred to Chen’s agreement to “provide data to a former member of the weather service with a written assurance not to tell anyone she was doing so.”

Several Asian-American legislators applauded the decision and are now calling for an investigation into the handling of Chen’s case.

“Unfortunately, there have been multiple cases in which Chinese American scientists like Sherry have been wrongfully targeted and arrested for alleged espionage only to have those charges dropped with no explanation,” Rep.

Smith responded by noting the federal government keeps records of people who died and that when people move they update their address with the state motor vehicle agency and the post office. The state could use that kind of evidence to determine whether someone had moved.

Smith also focused on the fact that in Ohio, the purging process is initiated when the state doesn’t get any response from a voter, not if mail cannot be returned. A process in which a state began a purging process based on returned undeliverable mail in addition to not voting for a period of three our four years would be more acceptable, he conceded, because the undeliverable mailing would provide the state with some kind of concrete evidence someone may have moved. Under Ohio’s current process, Smith said, 70 percent don’t respond to the confirmation mailing.

A handful of states use processes similar to the one used in Ohio, but civil rights groups say the state is particularly aggressive in purging people from the rolls. A ruling from the high court backing Ohio could embolden states to adopt more aggressive voting procedures.

Smith questioned why Ohio needed such an aggressive purging tactic at all, saying only 3 percent of Americans move each year and many take steps to update their address.

Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts seemed more skeptical of the challenge to the Ohio process. Alito at one point asked Smith whether someone not voting for 20 years would be enough of indication someone had moved, indicating to him it was. Smith noted that there were plenty of people in the United States who for a variety of reasons might not vote over 20 years. Larry Harmon, the plaintiff in the case, was purged after not voting for six years but had lived at the same address for about 16 years.

Justice Anthony Kennedy also seemed sympathetic to Ohio’s position, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke little and offered no clear indication of her thinking.

Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas did not speak during Wednesday’s oral argument.

The case is also notable because the Justice Department switched its position this summer after the Supreme Court agreed to hear it. The Department previously supported the challenge to the Ohio law in a brief at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but the Trump administration switched positions to back the state.

But on social media, not everyone was impressed by the fashion:

Sotomayor pressed U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco on the change during oral arguments Wednesday, saying that solicitors general from Democratic and Republican presidents alike had argued positions at odds with the one the Justice Department was now taking.
