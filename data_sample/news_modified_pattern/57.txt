For women in Hollywood, the path to success has too often been marred by explicit sexual commentary, unwanted groping and other uncomfortable advances from male colleagues and superiors who vastly outnumber them across the entertainment industry. A study released this week tells us by just how much.

The proportion of women working as directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers ― a group that shapes the stories told onscreen from their conception to filming to screening for audiences ― has remained virtually unchanged for two decades.

The annual “Celluloid Ceiling” report from San Diego State University’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film found that females comprised 18 percent of those in the influential behind-the-scenes roles in 2017′s top-grossing 250 films.

“There is absolutely no truth to this,” CNN said in a statement.

That’s just 1 percent more than the figure for 2016 ― as well as for 1998, the first year the center conducted its studies.

Researcher Martha M. Lauzen’s findings are jarring not just because roughly the same share of women were helping make movies in a year when “Wonder Woman” dominated screens as when “The Big Lebowski” came out. “I don’t want to tell people what to do or show them the new cool thing. Plenty of places do that. I want to teach them how to find — and understand — new and different things themselves and let them bring their friends along for the ride.”

Chang hopes to encourage open dialogue and create a platform “where people can consider culture and race and have strong opinions while exploring their passions,” he explained in the release.This whole country is going nuts, and the NRA is in our way

They’re responsible for this whole production

They hold the strings, they control the puppet

And they threaten to take donor bucks

So they know the government won’t do nothing and no one’s budging

“That means no parent of the 37,000 kids who eat meals at school need worry about how to pay that overdue debt,” a charity organizer wrote on the “Philando Feeds the Children” fundraising page.

“The monthly bill was paying down the expenditures .. Paul for two years at the time he was killed.

Families said students at the school took his death especially hard.

In 2017, around the anniversary of Castile’s death, families of children at J.J. Hill told the Pioneer Press that Castile often high-fived students and helped them with their lunches.

“It’s one thing to say he was a good guy, and it’s another thing to know he was a good guy,” Eisen Ramgren, a student’s parent, told the St. Thursday. (OLDAM and HANCOCK = RED)

Friday will mark at least the third day of widespread forced closures since Kentucky’s state Legislature passed the pension overhaul in a late-night vote two weeks ago. The day after the vote, teachers called in sick and closed schools in more than 25 counties.

The following Monday, an estimated 5,000 teachers protested in Frankfort, and schools in each of the state’s 120 counties that were not already closed for spring break shut down.

“We’re encouraging people to show up in force and make sure our legislators and our governor hear loud and clear that we shall not be moved,” said Gay Adelmann, the co-founder and president of Save Our Schools Kentucky. The nonprofit advocacy group has organized protests in Frankfort throughout the 2018 legislative session and will demonstrate again Friday.

Kentucky’s teacher protests, unlike those in West Virginia and Oklahoma, have focused largely on pension changes. The overhaul, which Gov. Paul newspaper.

“The film industry has utterly failed to address the continuing under-employment of women behind the scenes. This negligence has produced a toxic culture that supported the recent sexual harassment scandals and truncates so many women’s careers,” Lauzen said in a statement.

Despite the chorus of women saying #MeToo, the fight against sexual harassment and abuse may be stymied by entertainment industry workplaces that remain chock-full of men.

Other statistics in the report are equally damning: In 2017, 1 percent of the top-grossing 250 films employed 10 or more women behind the scenes, while 70 percent employed 10 or more men. Slightly less than one-third employed zero or only one woman in these roles, while none of the movies employed zero or only one man.

Among the jobs considered, women fared best as producers and executive producers, and worst as cinematographers ― a whopping 96 percent of films had no women helming the camera.

Lauzen’s study analyzed three different movie workforces: people who worked in key behind-the-scenes roles on the top-grossing 100, 250 and 500 films of 2017.

Fewer and fewer women are found on set as we move up the ranks of the films. While women made up 21 percent of key behind-the-scenes jobs in the 500-movie group, that number drops to just 16 percent among the top 100. The largest percentages of women were found working on documentaries, and action features showed the largest gender gap.

In addition to fostering a less “toxic culture,” as Lauzen put it, having more women storytellers can shape the stories that are told ― adding a diversity of experience that benefits everyone.

And there’s an easy potential fix: Hire more women directors.

Reinforcing findings of past studies, Lauzen determined that having women lead a film as director means that more women are brought on as writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers. For example, among 2017′s top-grossing 500 films, on those with at least one female director, women comprised 68 percent of writers. On films with exclusively male directors, women accounted for just 8 percent of writers.
