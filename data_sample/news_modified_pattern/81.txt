It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. — Donald J.”

More than 100 women have read victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing. Many called out USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University for disregarding or failing to report warnings about Nassar’s abuse.

It appears the organizations “only see us as a financial burden that needs to be silenced and squashed, devalued and discredited all while trying to say they are sorry it happened to us and are on our side,” survivor Larissa Boyce recently told HuffPost.

Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman wrote in a series of tweets this month that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for Nassar being allowed to continue his abuse for so long.

“We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again,” Raisman tweeted. ”... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”

Trump, in criticizing U.S. District Judge William Alsup for dealing him a legal setback, slammed the whole “Court System” as “broken and unfair.”

The White House, in a statement Wednesday, called Tuesday night’s ruling “outrageous.” The decision blocks the Trump administration’s plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children from deportation and allows them to work legally.

Trump has regularly responded to his administration’s setbacks in court by bashing the entire judicial system. Some of his attacks have come in cases involving his travel ban aimed at majority-Muslim countries, which federal judges on several courts, including the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, have deemed discriminatory.

Trump’s anti-court tweet on Wednesday singled out the Ninth Circuit, where judges have ruled against several high-profile cases involving his administration, and claimed the court favored “the opposing side.” The appeals court, based in San Francisco, includes several judges appointed by Republican presidents.

Trump’s incendiary tweets and rhetoric have hurt him in the courts. Lawsuits have cited his own words, such as his disparagement of Mexican immigrants as “rapists,” in attempting to prove that his travel ban and his DACA rollback have discriminatory intent.

A federal judge in Hawaii, in halting an early version of the travel ban last year, cited Trump’s anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric as “significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus.”Streets turned to seething rivers. Buildings inundated with debris. The mangled frames of abandoned cars, drenched in mud.

As Southern California takes on the heavy burden of cleaning up from what’s become a one-two punch of devastating wildfires followed by heavy rains that caused deadly mudslides, this is some of the detritus left behind.

In addition to the physical damage, the floods have taken a human toll as well. Santa Barbara County officials said Wednesday at least 15 people are dead and 20 injured thanks to the onslaught of mud and water.

“The only words I can really think of to describe what it looked [like] was it looked like a World War I battlefield,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said Tuesday. “It was literally a carpet of mud and debris everywhere.”

Here are some photos from the region:A ban on “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that attempts to change sexual orientation or gender identity, failed to pass Tuesday in New Hampshire’s House of Representatives.

Two proposed bills would have protected minors from treatments aimed at erasing LGBTQ identity that medical professionals have labeled ineffective and potentially harmful.

Both the House and Senate versions of the legislation failed narrowly in a vote that fell largely along party lines, with Republicans generally opposing any change to existing state law. The measure was introduced in the New Hampshire Senate by Sen. Martha Fuller Clark (D) after a similar change failed in the state two years ago.

Laws banning conversion therapy have been passed in at least nine states, Washington, D.C., and more than two dozen municipalities, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Florida’s Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, on Tuesday became the latest locale to ban conversion therapy.”

That’s when Blunt, 35, decided to straight-up call out her husband on his love of the film.

One day she came home and found Krasinski watching “The Devil Wears Prada,” she told Norton. She walked in right when Anne Hathaway’s character, Andy, is going through a style evolution, shown through a montage of Andy wearing what Blunt described as “numerous fabulous outfits.”

“He was watching the montage bit and he goes, ‘Annnnnnnnd, that’s my favorite outfit.’”

The American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association both caution against conversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy, on the grounds that it can be harmful. Its methods can include talk therapy, electroshock therapy and treating LGBTQ identity as an addiction.co/S04KGy1hFC — Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) February 28, 2018

Hope Hicks doesn't seem to realize that it's not just the white lies that are relevant, but that all lies matter. — Laurie Crosswell (@lauriecrosswell) February 28, 2018

Common white lies;



"I'm five minutes away"



"You look great"



"I'm fine"



"I was just about to call you"



"there was no collusion with the Russians"

Since coming to office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made becoming a “space flight superpower” a top priority for the Chinese government, which has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022.

The launch of the “Chongqing Liangjiang Star” rocket, developed by OneSpace Technology, a Beijing-based private firm, marks the first time a non-state Chinese rocket has successfully entered orbit, the official Xinhua news agency said.

The rocket is powered by a solid fuel engine developed by OneSpace and its control systems are customizable in accordance with user demand, the company’s chairman, Ma Chao, told Xinhua.

Also known as the OS-XO, the craft can place a 100-kilogram load into orbit 800 kilometers from the earth, according to state media.

The rocket uses energy-saving technology, such as wireless communications instead of wired internet that by cutting weight has helped lower fuel costs by about 30 percent, Xinhua said.

Founded in 2015, OneSpace is the result of a government effort to foster China’s commercial space flight and encourage private participation in the sector, according to state media.

The company expects 10 missions for carrier rockets in 2019, founder Shu Chang told the official China Daily last week.

Supporters of the New Hampshire legislation noted that being gay is not a mental health issue and should not be treated as such. Those who argued against the ban said it went too far in preventing counselors from talking to minors about temporary crushes.

Lawmakers also said they found no evidence the practice existed in New Hampshire, the Associated Press reported.

“Now, I would be against coercive therapy, but what about those who want help from a professional?” Republican Rep. Mark Pearson said Tuesday, WMUR-TV reported.

Pearson added that he thought the legislation was “unnecessary at best, and quite possibly harmful to youngsters that want an honest conversation” about sexual issues

Ray Buckley, chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, slammed House Republicans, saying in a statement they “are telling children that who they are is not good enough.”

The bills were also supported by the New Hampshire Log Cabin Republicans, a LGBTQ group whose co-chair, Jennifer Horn, called on her fellow conservatives to push a revised version forward after the votes..A little girl wrapped in a shawl waits along with her mother at a railway station in New Delhi, India, on the cold winter morning of Jan. 3, 2018.

Indian families’ traditional preference for sons over daughters has led to the existence of millions of “unwanted” girls in the country, a new government report estimates.

Many parents eager for boys continue to have children until the desired number of sons are born, according to a report released Monday as part of the finance ministry’s annual economic survey. A lot of daughters are born during this process, too. The report estimates that these “unwanted” girls number more than 21 million. As they grow up, they often receive poorer nourishment and less schooling than their brothers.

Despite those “unwanted” girls, India’s male-to-female sex ratio at birth still tilts significantly in favor of males. And it hasn’t improved even as incomes rise.
