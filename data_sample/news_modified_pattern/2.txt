Actor Tom Hanks said President Donald Trump’s administration has adopted a “guerrilla war” tactic with its relentless attacks on the press.

“I think it’s more of a guerrilla war that’s going on, it’s like chaos by any means,” Hanks said at the London premiere of his new movie, “The Post,” on Wednesday night.S. Citizen satisfaction surveys rate Norway as the world’s happiest country. And this was the case before they struck oil.

The place is pristine and almost crime-free. Indeed, from the perspective of Norway, it is America that looks like kind of a dritt hull – that’s Norwegian for shit-hole.

I wish I could end this piece right here.

The Hollywood star also said White House attempts to delegitimize the press with its “fake news” rhetoric could lead to “very, very scary territory” that is “not inclusive” and does not take in “the rights of everybody.”

Hanks’ movie deals with press freedom and The Washington Post’s battle to bring government secrets about the Vietnam War, known as the Pentagon Papers, to light.

Hanks, who previously revealed he’d likely turn down the chance to attend a White House screening of the movie, said people were “entitled” to their opinions and could have them “until the cows come home.”

“But you are not entitled to your own facts,” he added.S. As of this week, Mohammed remains in Turkey.

Both Cheteian and Mohammed also said they’ve contemplated suicide.

“No country is taking me, I have no way to go forward and no way to go back,” Cheteian said. “I am an international orphan.”

Kamal Hazbawi, 41, another Iranian refugee, is facing a deportation order from Turkish authorities. He expects to be tortured or executed if they send him back to Iran, he said, and the U.S. halted his resettlement process last July.

He said he emailed the U.S. officers he’d already communicated with on Wednesday about his pending deportation. They responded, but told him there was nothing they could do.

“I don’t know what to do. I’m really stressed and confused,” he said. “There are facts that are empirical, that are provable, that are confirmable.”

“Today, after spending 1,733 days in jail for allegedly committing crimes at a protest he never attended, American Ahmed Etiwy and his cousin were released from an Egyptian prison,” Praveen Madhiraju of the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International wrote in a Wednesday afternoon statement. “The two were released at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, an occasion that has been traditionally marked by such pardons.”

Etiwy was swept up in mass arrests during political protests in August 2013.

Then a 23-year-old student, he was held in a military facility and in prison for over three years before his mass trial with hundreds of others also accused of violence even began. The initial cell he was held in was so small and filled with detainees that they had to take turns sleeping on the floor because they could not all lie down at the same time, a witness told HuffPost last year.

An Egyptian judge sentenced Etiwy to five years in prison in September. I encourage all other investors who care about our future to do the same. #unfriendfacebook pic.

MISSOURI GOV. ERIC GREITENS ADMITS AFFAIR, DENIES BLACKMAIL CLAIMS The governor and his wife confirmed that he had engaged in an affair before being elected governor, but denied he blackmailed the woman involved with a compromising photo of her he took without consent. “For example, think of technological partnerships with groups of people working independently, like cooperatives. “I think we are going to see a lot of different formats for companies and corporations that we don’t have a good understanding for now.”

We spoke about what jobs were most threatened by tech. These included cashiers, highlighted by the opening of Amazon’s cashier-less store this week, and truck drivers with the eventual adoption of driverless trucks. Safer jobs—besides IT and STEM of course—might be gardening, dentistry and ministering. Although regarding the latter example, maybe not. There is now an app called Confession with a dropdown menu for sins!

The lively discussion continued with some great questions form the audience. [HuffPost]
