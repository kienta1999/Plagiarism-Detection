All eyes were on Lena Waithe as she attended the Met Gala in New York City on Monday night, and she didn’t miss the opportunity to make a bold, inclusive statement.

The “Master of None” writer and star, who is a lesbian, wore a Carolina Herrera tuxedo topped by a silk rainbow cape inspired by the LGBTQ pride flag. The cape included brown and black stripes to represent inclusion of people of color in the queer community.

The superhero-inspired ensemble was a nod to Waithe’s 2017 Emmy acceptance speech, in which she encouraged LGBTQ people to “put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren’t in it.”

“Tonight this cape is not imaginary,” she told Vogue, as seen in the video above. “I’m reppin’ my community ... I want everybody to know that you can be whoever you are and be completely proud and be doing it. Let’s not be afraid of who we are.”

Needless to say, her fans were here for it.

LENA WAITHE WEARING A PRIDE FLAG TO A CATHOLIC THEMED EVENT.. Wanna send prayers up for his Son and Family. Also his Nanny that’s in Serious Condition. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😢 — al harrington (@cheddahcheese7) February 26, 2018NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bill Cosby’s daughter, Ensa Cosby, who came to her father’s defense last year against accusations that he had sexually assaulted numerous women, has died at age 44 from a chronic kidney disease, a family spokesman said on Monday.

Ensa Cosby, the second-youngest of the entertainer’s five children and the third of his four daughters, died from renal disease, according to the spokesman, Andrew Wyatt. But he declined to give further details about the circumstances of her death.

“The Cosby Family thanks many people for their prayers for their beloved and beautiful Ensa, who recently died from renal disease,” Wyatt said in a statement.

The celebrity news website TMZ.com reported that Cosby’s daughter died on Friday night in Massachusetts.

The elder Cosby lost his son, Ennis, to gun violence more than a decade ago.

Ensa Cosby made headlines in May 2017 when she released a statement with her older sister, Erinn, on the popular radio show, “The Breakfast Club,” proclaiming their father’s innocence against the multiple rape allegations lodged against him.

The daughters said they were faithful listeners of the show and wanted to use it as a platform to criticize the media’s portrayal of their father, who was best known for his television role as the wise, witty dad on the long-running situation comedy “The Cosby Show.”

“The accusations against my father have been one-sided since the beginning, and when he tried to defend himself he was sued in civil court,” Ensa said in an audio statement that was aired during the morning show... He said he expects to go to trial within a year.

McIntosh, a chemical engineer and lawyer, spent the first 13 years of his career as an environmental permit compliance inspector in Michigan, according to his public LinkedIn page. In 1991, he joined Republican Gov. John Engler’s administration, serving as an environmental adviser and deputy director of Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality.

Engler abolished 19 citizen commissions and oversight boards and split the state agency in two, separating the Department of Natural Resources from the Department of Environmental Quality and reducing the budgets for both.

“It’s not good news for anybody who gives a damn about the environment in this country that McIntosh is going there,” Collins said. (If Jews can have their own homeland, the crooked logic goes, whites should get one too.)

A teen was able to make one hell of a statement by using a clever loophole — and a little help from Shonda Rhimes.

Krysta Montoya, an 18-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, confused the student body at Valley High School with her cryptic senior quote in the school’s 2018 yearbook.

“Grey’s Anatomy Season 5, Episode 6, 39:40,” the quote said.

Montoya told HuffPost that “most people didn’t understand it” and she got sick of explaining what it meant. So, on Monday, she decided to clear everything up on Twitter.

Just because everyone keeps asking me what my quote is. Here ya go. pic.twitter.com/tOKSh79viE — Krysta Ann🌻 (@krystaataa) April 30, 2018

The senior, who is set to graduate from high school later this month, was referencing a moment in Season 5, Episode 6 of “Grey’s Anatomy” in which the character Erica Hahn says, “I am so, so, so gay.”

The scene takes place about 3 minutes and 18 seconds into the episode, with 39:40 remaining.

“I just loved it,” Montoya told HuffPost. “I was watching ‘Grey’s’ and I saw it and I took a screenshot, so I kept it in my camera roll ever since.twitter.com/UuE1Asl0sc — Dylan (@scholaurship) May 7, 2018

The annual Met Gala marks the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute’s spring exhibition. This year’s show is “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” which prompted stars like Madonna and Rihanna to incorporate religious iconography into their designer couture.

While Waite’s interpretation may not have been as literal as those A-listers’, she nonetheless felt her outfit fit the evening’s theme perfectly.NBC

In a Tuesday morning appearance on “Megyn Kelly Today,” two women who dated R. Kelly shared disturbing details about how he allegedly abused and controlled them.

Asante McGee and Kitti Jones, who went public with their abuse accusations last summer, told host Megyn Kelly they both lived with the singer at different points over the past several years in Atlanta and Chicago.

“I had to wear sweatpants. I had to stand up when he would walk into a room,” said Jones, who says she began dating the R&B star in 2011.

Both women allege the singer controlled many aspects of their lives, including what they ate, when they used the bathroom, and who they spoke to on their phones, which he allegedly monitored by adding them to his personal phone plan.

“You would have to send a text message to one of his runners, just asking if you could go to the restroom, and they would relay the information to him,” Jones said. “You weren’t free to walk throughout the house.”

“We were required to call him ‘Daddy.’ You would address him as ‘Daddy,’” said McGee, who dated Kelly between 2014 and 2016. Both women said that not using the nickname would lead to punishment, like being slapped.

A BuzzFeed report published last July renewed questions about the singer’s behavior. “Parents of women and girls still living in his house accused him of “brainwashing” their children in a “cult.” Several others subsequently came forward with similar stories of abuse.

Kelly’s representatives have dismissed the claims as a “conspiracy.”

One woman living with Kelly, Joycelen Savage, has denied the claims against him, but Jones and McGee agreed that Savage has indeed been “brainwashed.” Jones also said she believes the singer was guilty of the child pornography charges he was ultimately acquitted of a decade ago.
