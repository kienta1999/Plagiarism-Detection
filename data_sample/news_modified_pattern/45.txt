This week’s Time magazine cover features an illustration of a hair-on-fire President Donald Trump, summarizing his multi-alarm first year in office.

Artist Edel Rodriguez, who also illustrated Time’s 2016 “Meltdown” cover featuring Trump, created the searing image to reflect the upcoming anniversary of Trump’s inauguration:

Rodriguez said the flames also evoke Trump’s taunts of North Korea, including his statement that the country would be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued threatening the United States.

“We used to live where the United States was a pretty steady country, and now you wake up every day and try to figure out where’s the next fire, where do we have to go, what do we have to try to contain,” Rodriguez said in the interview.

“It’s sort of this president that you’re always trying to contain, like a wildfire that’s moving from one place to the other at all times.”

Rodriguez also mocked up an idea for an illustration for Wolff’s book jacket ― also flame-fueled:

I've been asked what I would've done with the 'Fire and Fury' cover by some folks who think the existing cover design is a disaster and a missed opportunity, so here is what I might have done with it pic.twitter.com/xV8W3L8oYu — Edel Rodriguez (@edelstudio) January 7, 2018

A Cuban-American, Rodriguez told Time that free speech was the reason he left his homeland. This allowed us to record a steady improvement in air quality since the year 2000.

Thus, the carbon monoxide present in the air was reduced by 53 percent, hydrogen sulfide was reduced by 75 percent, benzene levels went down 90 percent, nitrogen dioxide is 77 percent lower, and sulfur dioxide was reduced by 81 percent from 2000 to 2016. In addition, fine particle concentrations in the air were also 38 percent lower in 2016 than they were in 2009. Since 2014, the average yearly fine particle concentration is even lower than the norm suggested by the World Health Organization.

However, we are still far from having won the battle. This is why the city has decided to adopt the bylaw concerning solid-fuel-burning devices and fireplaces. These devices are responsible for 39 percent of fine particle emissions, second only to transportation, responsible for 45 percent of those emissions. Our administration also wishes to invest in the greening of our city, by increasing the number of trees on its territory. This will not only improve air quality, but also fight against heat islands.

Société de transport de Montréal is hoping to expand its network of hybrid buses, such as those above, and also electric buses. STM

A few days ago, we also launched a call for tenders that will allow the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) to purchase 300 new hybrid buses, whereby we will considerably increase the quality of the network’s services, all while reducing our carbon footprint.

“The reason I left was to make my work and to speak freely, and so I’ll keep on doing it,” he said. He added that he’s “not inspired by [Trump] at all,” but feels he can “make pictures that communicate well.”

“I don’t really see that many people visually taking him on,” Rodriguez said. “It’s a bit of a responsibility for me to do it.”

Australia has just sweltered through its third hottest year on record, the country’s weather bureau has confirmed.

“Seven of Australia’s ten warmest years have occurred since 2005 and Australia has experienced just one cooler than average year in the last decade,” the BOM report said.

Barriers to Riding

It’s taken a while to get to this point. The first bike-shares were set up in more affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods, such as the Wall Street area in lower Manhattan, said Nathan McNeil, the urban studies researcher at Portland State University who authored the June report.

To some degree, he said, this made sense. Cities investing in bike-share programs wanted to demonstrate that they could be successful. He says he hasn't been drinking. pic.

Natural climate drivers in Australia, such as El Niño ocean conditions, were neutral, and there were cooler-than-average waters to Australia’s west and warmer-than-average waters to the east of Africa during the year.

This created a strong temperature gradient across the Indian Ocean, which favored a drying influence on Australia, the report said.

“Despite the lack of an El Niño — which is normally associated with our hottest years — 2017 was still characterised by very warm temperatures,” the bureau’s head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, told Newscorp on Tuesday.

Sydney sweltered through its hottest day in 80 years Sunday, while in neighboring Victoria, highway bitumen melted and bushfires burned out of control.

The brutal heat wave that gripped much of Australia over the weekend took a heavy toll on wildlife, with hundreds of bats in a colony in Sydney’s southwest dropping dead. The report landed as a tropical storm gathers and is forecast to make landfall at cyclone strength in West Australia on Saturday.

Despite the scorching end to 2017, it was also Australia’s 30th-wettest year in a record spanning 117 years, the BOM report found.

The area-average total was 8 percent above the 1961-1990 average of 465.2 millimeters (about 18.3 inches).

While rainfall was up in some areas, the 2017 figure was below average for most of inland Queensland, most of New South Wales, eastern to central Victoria, and all of Tasmania.

Rainfall was below average across southern Australia during the cooler months of May to September.
