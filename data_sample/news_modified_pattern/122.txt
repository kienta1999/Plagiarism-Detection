Tom Hardy is an actor known for physical transformations, be it sporting tribal tattoos for FX’s “Taboo,” developing a strapping physique for 2008’s ”Bronson” and then again for 2012’s “The Dark Knight Rises,” or donning a mask in two separate Christopher Nolan films (“The Dark Knight Rises” and “Dunkirk”), as well as, for a time, in George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road.” Nonetheless, his latest big-screen makeover may be his most drastic one yet — to the point that fans may not recognize him at all.

Hardy is next set to star as Eddie Brock, a reporter who bonds with an alien symbiote to become a spidery antihero in this October’s Marvel-based superhero film “Venom.” After that, however, he’ll be embodying one of America’s most notorious criminals, Al Capone, in “Fonzo,” about the 47-year-old mobster’s struggles with dementia following his 10-year stint in prison.

As proven by new photos from the ongoing production — in which Hardy chomps on a cigar, fires a rifle and wields a fishing rod while aboard a boat — he has packed on the pounds and lost some hair to play the iconic criminal, to the point that he barely looks like himself any longer.

I’M GOINNG TO LOSE MY MXXNXNNDDDDDD pic. Which, in turn, is a stark contrast to the below sneak peek of a far more svelte Hardy in the role, which the actor posted on Instagram in late March:

Co-starring Matt Dillon as Capone’s friend Johnny, Linda Cardellini as his wife, Mae, and Kyle MacLachlan as his doctor, Karlock, the film will be the first behind-the-camera effort for writer-director Josh Trank since 2015’s troubled, and dismally received, “Fantastic Four,” whose failure reportedly contributed to his departure from a standalone “Star Wars” feature rumored to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett. “Fonzo” doesn’t yet have a release date.

Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:A woman filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against rapper Young Lo, singer Chris Brown and dozens of others, alleging that Young Lo raped her multiple times while he and other defendants held her against her will at Brown’s home last February.

Prominent women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred is representing the woman, identified only as “Jane Doe” in the lawsuit, and is seeking damages for sexual battery, gender violence, battery, assault and negligence, among other charges, according to a copy of the suit that HuffPost obtained.

Anthony Willoughby, an attorney for Young Lo, whose real name is Lowell Grissom Jr., said in a statement that his client denies the accusations, noting they “originated last year ending with no arrests, no proof, an inconclusive rape kit and after a police investigation- no charges filed.”

“This civil lawsuit is a blatant attempt at a money grab and to harm the reputation of my client while encouraging PR noise for Gloria Allred while she exploits this young women [sic] for her own financial gains and public persona,” Willoughby continued.

The lawsuit alleges that Doe was at Los Angeles nightclub One Oak on Feb. 23, 2017, when Grissom invited her and her then-roommate to meet Brown. The roommates went to join him and Brown for an “afterparty” at a recording studio where people were using drugs and alcohol, which made Doe uncomfortable.

Grissom allegedly took Doe’s cellphone from her at the studio and refused to give it back until she and her roommate went with him to Brown’s house. Brown’s home was surrounded by a fence and gate that required a code, the suit alleges, and both men refused to give her phone back or a code so she could leave.

The woman says that during her time at the house, guests continued to consume alcohol and illicit drugs, which may have included marijuana, cocaine, and the MDMA-based drug molly.

“Brown handed each female guest, including Plaintiff, a clear pill filled with white

powder and instructed them to take it to have a “good time,‘” the lawsuit states. “Plaintiff reasonably interpreted Brown’s instruction to have a ‘good time’ at his house to mean that he expected his female guests to later perform sexual acts with him and others while under the influence of these substances.”

“Plaintiff, who wanted to remain alert and who did not want to perform sexual acts with anyone, did not follow these instructions and declined to consume the pill(s),” the suit added.

During the party, Doe claims she isolated herself from the others and became scared as she noticed the men were in “possession of multiple guns in the house.” Grissom allegedly lured the woman’s roommate upstairs under the pretense of returning her cellphone to her, and then told Doe that her roommate was upstairs waiting for her.

Doe says she told her roommate that she did not want to engage in sex with Grissom and Brown.

“Before Plaintiff could leave the bedroom, Grissom and Brown entered and closed the door behind them,” the lawsuit states. “They sat across from Plaintiff. Plaintiff spoke to Brown and Grissom, both of whom appeared to be under the influence of drugs. Plaintiff feared that they were out of control and that they would force themselves upon her in some manner against her will.”

The lawsuit also claims that a woman, identified as “Doe X,” entered the room with several other women, and Grissom then blocked the door with a couch at Brown’s request. While some of the women began to undress, Doe tried to distance herself from the group.

According to the lawsuit, Doe X pursued and violently grabbed Doe, forcing her to engage in oral sex with Grissom. (The lawsuit’s graphic description of the allegations follows.)

The lawsuit claims that Doe X pushed Doe down onto one of the beds in the room and sat on top of her face, using her legs to pin the woman down while forcing her to perform oral sex on her, the lawsuit claims.

“To compound Plaintiffs horror, Doe X was menstruating at the time,” the suit states. “While Doe X was forcing Plaintiff to perform oral sex on her, Grissom molested the lower half of Plaintiffs body using his mouth and hands.”

Doe X moved Doe to another room, where Doe decided to take a shower to clean the other woman’s bodily fluids off of her, the suit alleges. It was there that Grissom allegedly snuck into the shower and continued his molestation. When Doe tried to flee, Grissom allegedly pushed her onto a bed in the connected bedroom and raped her.

After that, Grissom allegedly took Doe to a laundry room and finally returned her phone to her. Regardless of background, all these people manage to find their way to the butt end of the same mental cul-de-sac.

A Troll Is Born

In early 2010, Smith had a stroke of good fortune when the fish business bailed him out. He hadn’t worked in almost two years, and the Monterey Bay case had become his lifeline. After years of squabbling, the restaurant finally paid him $35,000 to go away. But Smith failed to declare $30,000 of the settlement as income and ran afoul of the IRS, according to records from United States Tax Court.

“It seems as if he is traveling under a black cloud, some of which he causes,” his mother wrote of her son in an email that is part of another case file.

Smith had by then set up his own one-man private legal practice. His firm’s motto: “Live Invincibly. While she called a rideshare to leave, the lawsuit claims, Grissom raped her again.

The woman immediately sought treatment for rape and reported the alleged event to the police, the suit says.

At some point during the night, the lawsuit claims Doe’s mother grew worried because she couldn’t reach her daughter. The mother used tracking software to find her daughter’s cellphone location and asked police to perform a wellness check.)

Not only were those folks not nominated ― they weren’t even part of the conversation, which started during autumn’s Toronto, Telluride and Venice film festivals, the annual Oscar springboards.

Your opinions will vary on which of 2017′s performances were overlooked (mine are mere suggestions), but there’s no arguing that the Oscars campaign bible is far too cemented for its own good. Dictums about who is “overdue” for awards steer the conversation (see: Sam Rockwell), an affecting crying scene offers an instant boost (see: Margot Robbie in “I, Tonya”), and a little manipulation ― also known as category fraud ― repositions contenders in competitive races (see: Sony Picture Classics pushing “Call Me by Your Name” co-lead Armie Hammer in the supporting field, where he was snubbed).

Maybe change is coming. That “Get Out” managed four nominations ― including Daniel Kaluuya’s Best Actor nod ― despite being a genre-bending crowd-pleaser with massive profits to its name shows that some of the tired adages about what constitutes Oscar-caliber material have faded. (No horror-comedy hybrid has ever been recognized, and the last traditional horror flick to earn top-tier nods was “The Sixth Sense,” released in 1999.)

But as silly as it is to put too much stock in the Academy Awards, which have never been a true meritocracy, the nature of their monthslong campaigns and tried-and-true performance hallmarks are staid. Maybe next year we can shine a light on fewer Winston Churchills and more Dinas.Stephen Colbert has connected the dots on the relationship between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.” The president now “expresses concerns over sharing precisely those facts with [the] public.”

Sen.9 million to the Heartland Institute, a leading proponent of climate science denial, between 2008 and 2016, according to previously unreleased tax filings reviewed by HuffPost.

The foundation ramped up spending on climate denial in recent years, giving money to think tanks and groups that spread climate misinformation, including $200,000 to the Oregon Institute of Science and medicine, $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition and $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.

“Their funding is as egregious as the Kochs,” Beka Economopoulos, whose New York-based nonprofit The Natural History Museum organized the letter, told HuffPost. “They’re a lightning rod for controversy.

Some of the digital edits used in Vanity Fair’s 2018 Hollywood issue were unintentionally hilarious.

But at least one was no laughing matter.

James Franco — who was recently accused of sexual misconduct by five women — was supposed to be part of the magazine’s main feature. But the actor was digitally removed from the cover spread shortly before publication, per The Hollywood Reporter. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called the move “obstruction of justice by Donald Trump happening in real time.” He said the call “makes a mockery of national security and common sense. Brown allegedly refused to allow police through the gate to his property.

A representative for Brown did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

A judge granted Brown’s ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran a five-year restraining order against him in June of last year.
