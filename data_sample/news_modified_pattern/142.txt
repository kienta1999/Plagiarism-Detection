Ah, remember the days when the most controversial thing Kim Kardashian and Kanye West did was expose Taylor Swift on Snapchat?

As much as Swift would very much like to be excluded from the Kimye narrative, she still seems pretty bent out of shape about how things went down. At the opening night of her “Reputation” tour in Glendale, Arizona, on Tuesday, the singer seemingly called out Kardashian for turning her into the internet’s punching bag.

“A couple of years ago, someone called me a snake on social media and it caught on. And then a lot of people called me a lot of names on social media,” she told the crowd. “And I went through some really low times for a while because of it. I went through some times when I didn’t know if I was gonna get to do this anymore and I guess the snakes ... I wanted to send a message to you guys that if someone uses name-calling to bully you on social media and even if a lot of people jump on board with it, that doesn’t have to beat you. It can strengthen you instead.”

West Virginia officials reached a tentative deal Tuesday to end the strike by teachers and other public employees that closed schools across the state for four days, according to Republican Gov. Jim Justice.

At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Justice said the state agreed to give teachers and other school personnel a 5 percent raise and state employees a 3 percent raise, marking what could be a major victory for employees to cap the first statewide walkout in nearly three decades.

But Justice offered no clear plan to fix the shortfall in the state employee health care program, which was at the top of many workers’ lists of demands.

Teachers are expected to return to school on Thursday after a “cooling off” period on Wednesday. The arrangement still needs to be approved by the state legislature, and union leaders said they reserve the right to reinstate the strike if the deal falls through.

“This has been a huge step in the right direction,” said Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, one of the two teacher unions that led the strike.

Teachers and other school employees in all 55 counties across the state were onboard with the strike, making an unprecedented show of solidarity after years of stagnant wages. West Virginia is ranked 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay and is wrestling with a teacher shortage that’s left 700 positions unfilled.

The governor acknowledged some missteps in his handling of the work stoppage, saying he started to think differently about it after a conversation with a student.

“To be perfectly honest, in a lot of ways I was looking at this maybe not correctly,” Justice said. “I was looking at it as what was the prudent thing to do, and maybe not at education as an investment. I went home and thought a lot about it. In the videos, Swift can be heard approving certain lyrics from the song “Famous,” which she had previously described as “misogynistic.”

She was quickly branded as a snake, thanks in part to Kardashian’s thinly veiled tweet about celebrating National Snake Day. The beauty mogul wrote, “They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!” before including a bunch of snake emojis.

Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍 — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 17, 2016

The backlash prompted Swift to take an extended, monthslong break from the spotlight. She has still yet to give an interview about the feud. CEO Michael Corbat was unaware of the loan when he met with Kushner on March 3, 2017, the bank said. The $325 million loan — for a Kushner building in Brooklyn — came through less three weeks later. Corbat discussed trade policy with Kushner, according to the letter, and nothing about the loan. When she was ready to return, however, the singer flipped it and reversed it, making the snake a central part of the aesthetic for the new album.

At the concert on Tuesday night, she danced alongside a giant snake, in addition to adorning microphones and costumes with serpentine imagery.

“I think something that came out of it that was good is that I learned a really important lesson that I’ve been telling you from the stage for about 10 years, but I never had to learn it so harshly myself — and that lesson has to do with how much you value your reputation,” Swift said onstage.

“The lesson is that you shouldn’t care so much if you feel misunderstood by a lot of people who don’t know you, as long as you feel understood by the people who do know you; the people who will show up for you, the people who see you as a human being.”

TOKYO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - One man was killed and at least 11 people injured, some critically, when rocks from an erupting volcano rained down on skiers at a mountain resort in central Japan on Tuesday and an avalanche soon after the eruption engulfed about a dozen skiers.

Six of those trapped were members of Japan’s Ground Self Defence Force (SDF) engaged in winter training maneuvers, Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said.

All were rescued but most were injured and one of them later died, the Defence Ministry said.

Japanese media reported that at least 12 people were injured, many apparently hit by volcanic rocks. Two were critically injured and three seriously, national broadcaster NHK said.

The youngsters totally nailed their impressions of Trump, especially the one who expertly mocked his two-handed drinking style .

Swift is just beginning her massive tour, so who knows what else she might reveal on the road, but at least we can expect her energy to be focused on just one feud at a time.

Before the show, the singer revealed that none other than Katy Perry, whom she’s been at odds with for years, sent her a literal olive branch and note to wish her luck on opening night.
