While Monday night’s Met Gala, with its celebration of the “Catholic imagination,” left us #blessed, it left one couple in soon-to-be wedded bliss. “And women so often lose their own identify to the identity of the men that they’re with. They even change the way they dress and what they do to fit the men that they’re with.”

“We’re starting to acknowledge our own gifts as women and not think that we have to behave as men in order to be empowered or powerful or valuable,” Stone added.Simone Biles came forward on Monday with allegations of sexual abuse by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.

Mekhi Lee, Dirone Taylor and Eric Rogers II were shopping at the Rack in Brentwood, Missouri last week when they noticed store employees watching and following them around the store. There was a brief altercation in the retailer when a customer allegedly called them “punks” and asked “are your parents proud of you for what you do?”, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The trio then made a purchase, which Rogers told the publication was “to show them that we’re equal and we didn’t have to steal anything.”

Despite this, the Brentwood Police met them in the parking lot as they were leaving and accused them of theft. An investigation showed that they were innocent, and police let them go without charges.

Brentwood’s chief of police Joseph Spiess told The Washington Post that the department was told “three black men, including one in a blue sweatsuit” were “shoplifting ’handfuls of products.’” Spiess told the publication that the officers listened to the three men and “put the story together.”

“They were satisfied that nothing happened,” said Spiess.

After the incident made waves online over the weekend and beyond, Nordstrom Rack president Geevy Thomas flew to St. Louis to apologize on behalf of the company in person. Critics on Twitter likened the situation to the incident that unfolded last month at a Starbucks in Philadelphia, when cops arrested two black men in the shop after a store manager called authorities on them for “trespassing.”

So in just the past couple weeks, we've had white folk summon police on black folk for no discernible reason at:

➡️ Starbucks (waiting)

➡️ A golf club (golfing too slow)

➡️ An AirBnB (checking out)

➡️ Nordstrom Rack



Am I missing any?

Anybody telling you racism "doesn't exist anymore" is a devil and should be treated as one.



And you did miss one: Police were called on a former white house staffer for moving into his own apartment because he's black.Thousands of Oklahoma teachers descended on the state Capitol in Oklahoma City for the second straight day Tuesday, demanding that legislators restore school funding after years of deep cuts and stagnating salaries.

Most school districts around the state remained closed for the day, while many went ahead and announced they would remain closed for at least the rest of the week. The momentum at the Capitol on Tuesday suggested teachers were game for a prolonged walkout until lawmakers passed a package they would accept.

The Oklahoma Education Association, the teachers union coordinating the strike, criticized the state House of Representatives for not moving on legislation Monday, when teachers first filled the Capitol to protest. The chamber went into a special session on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the dispute.

“This disrespect from lawmakers only drives the anger and frustration of teachers and education supporters, and it’s why Oklahomans from every corner of this state have no trust in this legislature,” the union’s president, Alicia Priest, said in a statement. 🖕Nordstrom Rack. https://t.co/aBPvrjb2k1 — DJ Pain 1 (@djpain1) May 8, 2018

And were the Nordstrom Rack employees charged for filing a false police report since the TEENS didn’t steal anything? Hold them as accountable as you want to hold black people.

The United Nations Security Council adopted a round of sanctions against North Korea in December, targeting exports of gasoline, diesel and refined oil to the country.

“We imposed, today, the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before,” Trump said Friday in remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. “Hopefully, something positive can happen.

Nordstrom Rack leadership told St. Louis Dispatch in a statement that they didn’t “handle this situation well” and have “apologized to these young men and their families.”.

Finally, every four years, it requires the president to submit to Congress a plan to repeal, modify or keep the authorizations. If Congress does nothing within 60 days, the existing AUMF stays in place.

“For too long, Congress has given Presidents a blank check to wage war,” Kaine said in a statement. “We’ve let the 9/11 and Iraq War authorizations get stretched to justify wars against multiple terrorist groups in over a dozen countries, from Niger to the Philippines. Our proposal finally repeals those authorizations and makes Congress do its job by weighing in on where, when, and with who we are at war.”

Here’s a copy of the bill.

Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has scheduled a hearing to debate, amend and vote on his legislation next week.

“There have been a number of efforts over the years to update these authorities,” he said in a statement. I thought she was a great 19th-century woman writer and editor of their newspaper, The Dial. I was thinking about her and reading about her — I had many books — and I was also reading about him. He gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall while I was shooting “The Exorcist.” I went to the lecture, and while I was sitting there, I went, “Margaret Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, Boston.” I made the connection, and I wrote to him and told him I was interested in talking to him about his aunt. His secretary called back and said, “You can have two hours in the Boston airport at this date, or you can have five hours in the Chicago airport on this date. “I am pleased that we have reached an agreement on a product for the committee to consider and that I hope will ultimately strike an appropriate balance of ensuring the administration has the flexibility necessary to win this fight while strengthening the rightful and necessary role of Congress
