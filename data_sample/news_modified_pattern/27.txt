“It’s a phony document,” Arpaio told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday, claiming to have “evidence” that he document isn’t real, but providing no proof for his allegation.

“We have the evidence, nobody will talk about it, nobody will look at it, and anytime you want to come down or anybody we’ll be glad to show you the evidence,” said Arpaio, who announced his Senate run this week.

It’s hardly the first time the former sheriff ― who was last year convicted of misdemeanor criminal contempt of court for defying an order to stop racially profiling Latinos ― has claimed Obama’s birth certificate is fake. He was one of the loudest voices in the birther movement, which suggests that the country’s first black president was not born in the U.

Supporters of the California laws and “sanctuary” policies in general argue that they make communities safer by allowing local police to work better with immigrant communities and focus time and resources on duties other than immigration matters. (“Sanctuary” policies differ widely from place to place and there is no set definition for the term.)

California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) responded to Sessions’ suit Tuesday evening, calling it a “political stunt.”

“At a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,” he said in a statement. “Jeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don’t work here. SAD!!!”

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) also defended his state’s policies.

“In California, our state laws work in concert with federal law,” Becerra said in a call with reporters Tuesday evening.S., and sent a deputy to Hawaii in 2012 to investigate.

The birther hoax first came to light during Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, but was revived in 2011 when conservative public figures, including Trump, talked about it. Obama had already released a short-form birth certificate in 2008, but the scrutiny led him to in April 2011 release a long-form version. Nevertheless, Trump and Arpaio continued to loudly express doubts about its authenticity.

Trump has repeatedly said that he doesn’t regret questioning the legitimacy of Obama’s presidency, even suggesting that he only abandoned the movement to focus on his own presidential run.

“I was the one that got him to put up his birth certificate,” Trump said while campaigning in September 2016. “I’m very proud of it.”

Trump and Arpaio, united by birtherism and their shared hard-line immigration views, solidified their camaraderie in August, when the former sheriff received Trump’s first presidential pardon.In an effort to protect the true creator of a private online list of men in the media who have been accused of sexual misconduct, multiple women are taking credit for it after concerns arose that the author was about to be “outed.”

Dayna Tortorici, editor of n+1 magazine, tweeted Tuesday that she was aware of a possible story in the works at Harper’s Magazine that aimed to name the author of the “Shitty Media Men” list. Tortorici and many other women quickly posted on Twitter advising against “doxxing,” in which a person’s identifying information is revealed online.

“It’s come to my attention that a legacy print magazine is planning to publish a piece ‘outing’ the woman who started the Shitty Media Men list,” Tortorici tweeted Tuesday. “All I can say is: don’t. The risk of doxxing is high. It’s not the right thing to do.”

“Shitty Media Men,” a Google document, began to circulate in a “whisper network” of women after the wave of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein came to light in October. BuzzFeed exposed the list, designed to collect information on accused men, in an article that pushed its creator to take the list down.

Women feared the consequences of naming the author, who seemingly intended the document only as a way for victims in the media industry to collect information in a safe, private manner.

Nicole Cliffe, co-founder of The Toast blog site, offered to pay freelancers to pull articles from Harper’s magazine after sources told her the publication was working on the piece. The Washington Post and The New York Times both reported Wednesday that Katie Roiphe, the writer supposedly behind the story, had no intention of naming anyone in the article.

I'm interrupting my break for one tweet only, so take a screenshot: I created the shitty men in media list. You don't need to doxx me, just head to my Instagram account, it's easy to find out where I hang out if you want to say hi. — Lexi Alexander ‎ (@Lexialex) January 10, 2018

Michael McCormack, 53, on Monday took up the post as Australia’s new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, Barnaby Joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.

Congrats to Michael McCormack, new deputy PM, who wrote this in 1993 when I was eleven. Really clean.

The president has called himself a “clean hands freak” and considers handshaking “one of the curses of American society.”

In addition to an obsession with cleanliness, Trump is in love with the word, as the below mashup by Vice News helpfully demonstrates.

It shows the president saying “clean” over and over ― making the word almost seem a hypnotic mantra. It later emerged that Kadar, whom his mother described as autistic and suffering from a brain tumor, sold his bomb threat services on the dark web.

“Our goal in the Audit is not to count anti-Semites, but rather to document cases where Jews were targeted for assault, vandalism and harassment,” an ADL spokesman explained to HuffPost.

“Regardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. The bomb threats sowed fear and anxiety among Jews across the country.”

The report similarly states that the desecration of seven Jewish cemeteries in 2017 — most of which occurred at the beginning of the year — “contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege.”

The ADL’s report adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a rise in hate in America. A recent report, also from the ADL, found that white supremacists in the U.S. killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America. (Already in 2018, a neo-Nazi allegedly murdered a gay Jewish college student in California.)

Hate crimes rose about 5 percent in 2016, according to the latest FBI tally, marking the first time in over 10 years that the country has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crimes.

Preliminary hate crime statistics for 2017 — collected by Brian Levin, a professor at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino — showed a 20 percent rise in hate crimes in 13 large American cities.

Earlier this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its annual “Year in Hate and Extremism” report, identifying 954 hate groups in the U.S. – an increase of 4 percent from 2016.President Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser is leaving the White House, officials confirmed Thursday. pic.twitter.com/mlhi80W73k — Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) February 25, 2018

Some LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack’s elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.

While welcoming McCormack’s apologies, just.

McGahn believed that firing Mueller would only add to speculation over whether the president had obstructed justice by attempting to interfere with the probe.

Mueller, according to the Times, found out about the attempt to fire him “in recent months.”

Trump dismissed the report to a group of reporters on Monday, referring to the article as “fake news. Typical New York Times.”

The White House didn’t immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is leading its own probe on Russian interference, responded to the Times report in a statement Thursday evening.

“I’ve said it before, and I am saying it again: firing the Special Counsel is a red line that the President cannot cross. Any attempt to remove the Special Counsel, pardon key witnesses, or otherwise interfere in the investigation, would be a gross abuse of power, and all members of Congress, from both parties, have a responsibility to our Constitution and to our country to make that clear immediately,” Warner said.

Trump has previously denied that he plans to remove Mueller from the investigation, but said in December he has an “absolute right” to control the Department of Justice.equal spokesman Rodney Croome called on him to “walk the talk” and support initiatives to help LGBTQI Australians overcome isolation, prejudice and suicide in parts of rural Australia.

“The apologies Mr. McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk,” Croome said in a statement.

“He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.”

McCormack issued a fresh statement in August last year apologizing for the editorial. When he issued the August apology, he was small business minister and had ministerial responsibility for the same-sex marriage postal vote.

“I have grown and learnt not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique,” he said at the time.
