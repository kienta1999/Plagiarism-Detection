O Lord, grant me the confidence of a mediocre wm who listens to an author speak for an hour about her life and then feels the need to attempt to shame her into not fitting into the falsely informed vision of whom he expects her to beThe Kardashian women are finally speaking out about what went down between Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna.

In case you forgot, the couple, who have a child together, are still embroiled in a multi-pronged legal battle after he posted explicit photos of her on his Instagram account, likely violating the revenge porn law in California.

In a clip from this past Sunday’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” episode, Kim and Khloé Kardashian react to their brother’s social media outburst and shed some light on the family’s opinion of his tumultuous relationship.

“Did you see how I just went off on Rob in our group text?” Kim said. “I couldn’t take it.”

Khloé suggests there’s a “plus and a minus” to the situation, saying there’s no way Rob and Chyna could reconcile after this ― which apparently is a good thing.

“The negative is just that, like, with Rob having sisters, he should just know better,” Kim added.

The DEA insists that since his release from a long-term Mexican prison term, Caro Quintero has risen to become the number two person in charge of the Sinaloa Cartel, the largest drug trafficking organization in the Americas.

Caro Quintero, 65, denies having returned to drug trafficking since his release. And the aging fugitive trafficker is now a shell of his former self, according to an interview with Mexican journalist Anabel Hernández for HuffPost published earlier this month. He lives in a roving campsite in the mountains of Sinaloa, plagued by the fear of drones flying overhead and hobbled by a diseased prostate that he refuses to operate on for fear of getting caught.

But acting DEA Administrator Robert Patterson said that Caro Quintero had attempted to “rewrite history” in the interview.

“What he claims is vengeance is actually the governments of Mexico and the United States jointly working to hold him accountable,” Patterson said. “He’s not just an old man living out his final days.S. demands, it appears that Trump may not have the legal authority to keep that promise.

“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”

Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.

“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.

The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.

“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.

Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.

“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.

Because the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented by legislation that passed both chambers of Congress in 1993, it would take a new act of Congress to end U.S. participation.

At least that’s the view some NAFTA proponents are taking. Others disagree, and believe Trump, under a 1974 law, has the ability to withdraw – although his doing so would almost certainly bring legal challenges.

Jon Johnson, who helped negotiate the original NAFTA for the Canadian government, said he personally believes Trump lacks the authority to pull out on his own, but in any event is certain that Trump taking that step would generate an ugly fight over separation of powers in the United States. “Unless he had the concurrence of Congress, it would be a real mess,” he said.”

Shortly after the press conference, the U.S. “He should have just, like, controlled himself.”

However, Khloé, who’s been known to come to Rob’s defense over the years, refused to go too hard on her brother.

“It just sucks,” she said. “He’s made out to [be] this bad guy when [Chyna] is taunting him. Love makes you do fucked-up things. Do you think anyone’s proud of that? No. You don’t fuck with someone’s heart and emotions.”

Rob’s Instagram meltdown led Chyna to obtain a restraining order and fed into a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Dream. The two eventually agreed to joint custody, but they’ve gone back and forth in court over allegations of domestic abuse, vandalism and extortion.

“So Rob and Chyna have officially broken up, but they obviously still have to communicate for the custody of Dream,” Khloé said. “They’re still having a hard time getting along. The legal battle that has been going on between the two of them has been super frustrating. I feel like this is escalating to a place that none of us could have ever imagined.”Fake Melania Trump had her say on Michael Wolff’s tell-all book about her husband’s administration on Wednesday’s “The Late Show.”

The first lady, played by Laura Benanti, called Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House “pure fiction” and a “fake book.”

“Every single word is lie,” she told host Stephen Colbert. But the fake first lady did later admit that at least one aspect of the tome rang true.Natalie Portman is in talks to replace Reese Witherspoon as an astronaut in the upcoming movie “Pale Blue Dot.”

Witherspoon had been set to star in the film, about an astronaut who loses her grip on reality after returning home from a long space voyage.

However, she withdrew in November because of scheduling conflicts with the second season of HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” according to Variety. Witherspoon will continue co-producing “Pale Blue Dot.co/p5Ki8Kr0xl — Em! (@Aemilius_) April 4, 2018

Shepard also had something to say about the post:What this means is anyone’s guess ― but Drake’s interest seems like it rates above mere professional admiration.

It was just last season when Drake wore a “Woman Crush Everyday” sweatshirt with Burke’s face on the front, and then invited her to dinner at his house via another reporter on the air.A mob of far-right nationalists attacked the 75-year-old mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece, on Saturday, leaving him hospitalized after he was beaten and thrown to the ground.

Mayor Yiannis Boutaris was attending a ceremony honoring Greeks killed in World War I when around a dozen ultra-nationalists also gathered at the event assaulted him.

Boutaris, who has been outspoken about his liberal policies, suffered kicks to the head and other injuries.

“RBG” deepens viewers’ legal knowledge by documenting her years at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, introducing the audience to some of the plaintiffs she represented.

During these cases, instead of getting frustrated by male judges who ridiculed her and could not seem to grasp the scope of gender discrimination, Ginsburg patiently educated them on legal history, seeing these moments of animosity “always as an opportunity to teach,” as she says in the film.

“One of the things I tried to plant in their minds was, think about how you would want the world to be for your daughters and granddaughters,” she recalls.

According to the film, she was focused on changing the system from within, smartly recognizing that the best strategy was to build a bulletproof legal doctrine through each gender discrimination case that she took on.

“I said, it’s too soon,” she said during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993, recounting one of her earlier cases. A crowd of angry men hurled bottles and chased him from the commemoration following the attack, after which aides took the mayor to Thessaloniki’s Ippokrateio General Hospital where he was kept overnight.”

“Pale Blue Dot,” which Variety said is set to begin production this spring, was inspired by a true-life 2007 astronaut love triangle in which a female mission specialist tried to kidnap a rival.
