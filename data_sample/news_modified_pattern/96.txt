“Love this product.. Telling others about the abuse takes strength. Talking to family, friends, clergy, counselors and, later, the FBI, I would often find myself struggling to find the words to convey an adequate picture of the situation.”

She added that it takes strength to face people who simply don’t believe your experience. It also takes strength to put “the pieces of your life back together” after leaving your abuser.

“Being strong — with excellent instincts and loyalty and smarts — does not inoculate a person against abuse. It doesn’t prevent her from entering into a relationship with an abuser,” Holderness wrote. “Abuse often doesn’t manifest itself early on — only later, when you’re in deep and behind closed doors. The really ugly side of Rob’s abuse only came out after we married, following three years of dating.”

Holderness also addressed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declined to comment on whether she believes Holderness’ and Willoughby’s allegations.

Congratulations on "Neverland," @HOLLAND_vvv. From the music to the MV, everything about this release is K-pop at its finest, it just happens to focus around a same-sex relationship. I hope this inspires others. You have my full support: https://t.co/0eMiWthZzN #HollandDebutDay — Jeff Benjamin (@Jeff__Benjamin) January 21, 2018

I admire Holland for his bravery and courage. It takes a lot of guts to be an open gay in a country which is closed minded when it concerns the LGBT+ community. I hope the people of Korea open up their mind to this #HollandDebutDay pic.twitter.com/AXTrTGoybN — . (@ultchanyeolpark) January 21, 2018

As of Monday afternoon, the “Neverland” video had been viewed more than 1.6 million times.By Chris Riotta

John Peery self-identifies as a few things: he’s a straight white male, an actor who goes by the stage name “John Pizza” and, perhaps most importantly, a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” super fan. He and his girlfriend, Candace Thompson, watch the show at viewing parties hosted by Syndicated, their local watering hole in Brooklyn, each week.

“While I cannot say I am surprised, I expected a woman to do better,” she wrote.

Head over to The Washington Post to read Holderness’ full essay. Have tried others but none worked like this one. My son has cracked hands & this is helping him. Using this & his hands don’t hurt like they did.” — Amazon Reviewer

“My hands are severly chapped, flakey and red due to chemo meds that I must take. I’ve tried so many creams, ointments, body butters....you name it. Then someone told me about this stuff, so I thought what the heck. It has sure helped! While it hasn’t gone away completely, it has helped with the flakeyness and redness. Your case matters.”

In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary.

“One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,” Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary “holds up a real hard mirror” to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.

And the film is a hard one to look away from. I would recommend it.” — Amazon Reviewer

“No pun intended, but, hands down the best hand cream I’ve ever used. Every winter I get small extremely painful cracks at my finger tips. This cream works in well and leaves my hands feeling light and smooth with a very faint fragrance, not greasy and unable to touch anything. Cracks heal quickly. Great product.” — Amazon ReviewerEmily Ratajkowski announced that she is the new ambassador for the hair care brand Kérastase on Tuesday, but it was her controversial social media post about her new role that seemed to get the most attention online.

Some fans are looking for an apology after the model and actress wrote on Instagram and Twitter, “Hair is a fundamental part of beauty, femininity, and identity. So excited to announce that I am the new face of @kerastase_official! Welcome good hair days!”

The first sentence of that caption has since been removed on her Instagram post, and the tweet has been deleted altogether.

She's hot but @emrata is an ignorant fool. What a horrible caption that implies that women with heredity hair loss or have lost hair due to illness are not beautiful or feminine enough. @KerastaseUSA @KerastaseUK: You're better than that. pic.twitter.com/Z7qk1EfQ17 — Rachel McArthur (@raychdigitalink) January 9, 2018

But before the update, outraged fans and followers on social media were quick to call out Ratajkowski and Kérastase for suggesting that having hair is essential to being a woman.

Many pointed out that the caption could be hurtful to people undergoing treatment for cancer, or to people who suffer from hair loss or thinning hair.

Hey @emrata - no, hair truly is not fundamental to beauty/femininity. Please cancel your mind numbing preachings on “empowerment”.

“I don’t know how you survive this one, and if he has to go, it’s because he never should have been there in the first place,” Christie said on ABC News’ “This Week.”

Trump reportedly phoned Pruitt on Monday evening and told him to “keep your head up” and “keep fighting.” In a meeting with leaders of Baltic nations at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said, “I hope he’s going to be great.”

Democrats, meanwhile, are calling on Pruitt to resign “immediately.”

“It is long past time for Scott Pruitt’s tenure to end. From cozying up to industry insiders, to wasting taxpayer dollars and breaking ethical norms, Americans cannot trust Pruitt and he should resign immediately,” the Democratic National Committee said in a statement.

The Senate confirmed Pruitt last year by a vote of 52-46. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, two vulnerable Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states Trump won in 2016, joined nearly every Republican in voting to approve Pruitt’s nomination.

Neither Manchin’s spokesperson nor Heitkamp’s spokesperson immediately responded to a request for comment about whether the senators thought Pruitt should step down.Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest owner and operator of local TV stations in the U.S., is under fire this week for requiring dozens of its news anchors to recite an on-air critique of “fake” news stories, echoing the language of President Donald Trump and his allies in their attacks on the media.

Sorry @emrata honey but you’re not a feminist / activist. Your statement about hair being fundamental to someone’s identity was shallow as hell, Im pretty sure you’re just a hypocrite. Xoxo Coco pic.twitter.com/4ykNJALhpk — baby coco (@youngbabycoco) January 9, 2018

Learned to love myself & appreciate the things that make me unique.. as long as I have a long flowing perfect bouncy blow dry. You’re not kidding anyone #fundamentallybasic — Jessica Hayley-Marie (@JessHayleyMarie) January 9, 2018

Some were angry that Ratajkowski changed her caption after the backlash, but didn’t issue an apology. Ratajkowski did not immediately return a request for comment from HuffPost.

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.

A spokesperson for Kérastase apologized in a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday. It was unclear what role, if any, the company played in writing the caption.

“We are deeply sorry if we offended anyone, it was absolutely not our intention,” the statement read. “We recognize that the way the content was presented did not pay tribute to our most valued message ― that everyone is uniquely beautiful. Kérastase is committed to empowering all women and all visions of beauty.”

Kérastase also posted another apology in a comment on its Instagram account:

Of course beauty is not defined by your hair, beauty is something more spiritual, beauty is an attitude coming from inside each of us. Our new muse, Emily, thinks that her hair is a way to express herself. As she said, “Everyone is uniquely beautiful in their own way” and we agree. We apologize for the misunderstanding of our previous caption because it seems like we were making a one-way statement, forgetting the rest of the multiple variations of beauty. We honestly tell you we’re very sorry and thanks for your testimony because through it we are learning everyday.
