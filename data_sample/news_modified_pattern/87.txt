Ricky Martin and fiancé Jwan Yosef have tied the knot.

Speaking to E! News at the Tuesday premiere of “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” in Los Angeles, the actor-singer said he’s officially “a husband,” but remained mum on specifics of the nuptials.

“We exchanged vows,” the 46-year-old said, “and we’ve signed all the papers that we needed to sign, prenups and everything.”

Married life, he added, “feels amazing.”

“I can’t introduce him as my fiancé,” he said. “He’s my husband. He’s my man.”

It was a surprising admission for Martin, who told Andy Cohen last year that he and Yosef wanted their wedding to be a “big” affair that lasted three days.

A larger celebration, Martin said Wednesday, was still in the works. “We’re doing a heavy party in a couple of months,” he explained. “I’ll let you know.”

The Grammy winner was introduced to Yosef, who is an artist, through Instagram. The couple made their red carpet debut at the 2016 amfAR Inspiration Gala in São Paulo, Brazil, and got engaged in November of that year.If you’re doing Whole30, you’re already aware of the struggle involved. If you know someone doing Whole30, you’ve likely heard about the struggle.

The diet plan, which focuses on consuming more whole foods, has grown in popularity over the past few years. Whole30 lasts ― you guessed it ― 30 days, and includes foods like eggs, vegetables, fruit and meat (there’s also a vegan version). Alcohol, sugar, dairy, legumes and grains are not compliant, meaning some condiments and even pickled vegetables are forbidden.

Whole30 has received both praise and criticism. Fans say the food plan can lead to more energy and feeling better overall, and may help with weight loss (although it is not marketed for that). Others say Whole30 can be too restrictive and could mess with the body’s microbiome.

The bottom line is Whole30 can be a challenge for anyone. If you’re on the journey (or even if you’re not), we rounded up some hilarious tweets to make you laugh ― and hopefully ease the pain.

Al-Qaida had been able to pull off that operation partly because U.S. intelligence agencies — several of which had collected bits of intelligence regarding the plotters before the attack — had not shared the material within the intelligence community. Brennan wanted a process in which NSA, FBI and CIA experts could freely share with each other the information each agency had on the Russian operation — even the most secret information that tended not to be disseminated throughout the full intelligence community.

Brennan realized this was what he would later call “an exceptionally, exceptionally sensitive issue.” Here was an active counterintelligence case — already begun by the FBI — aiming at uncovering and stopping Russian covert activity in the middle of a U.S. presidential campaign. And it included digging into whether it involved Americans in contact with Russia.

While Brennan wrangled the intelligence agencies into a turf­-crossing operation that could feed the White House information on the Russian maneuver, Obama convened a series of meetings to devise a plan for countering whatever the Russians were up to. The meetings followed the procedure known in the federal government as the “interagency process.” The protocol was for the deputy chiefs of the relevant government agencies to meet and hammer out options for the principals — that is, the heads of the agencies — and then the principals hold a separate (and sometimes parallel) chain of meetings to discuss and perhaps debate before presenting choices to the president.

But for this topic, the protocol was not observed.

Houston died at age 48 in 2012, accidentally drowning in a bathtub with additional complications of heart disease and cocaine use. Three years later, Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina, 22, was found unresponsive in a bathtub, and died six months later.

HuffPost has reached out to Houston’s estate for a comment, as it’s unclear whether West paid the National Enquirer or a family member to license the photo.

On Thursday, West celebrated the impending the release of the album, writing that he’s “really proud of what we put together.”

“We’ve spent a year and a half digging for samples and writing,” he continued. “I really appreciate the overwhelmingly positive response that we’ve been receiving. 🙏🙏🙏.”

Jokes aside, there is one vital note: It’s important to talk to a doctor before doing any major overhaul to your eating or lifestyle habits, including trying out Whole30. What works for someone else, whether that’s this diet plan or another one, may not work for you. If you do decide you want to go on a Whole30 plan, checking in with a professional can help you do it as safely as possible.
