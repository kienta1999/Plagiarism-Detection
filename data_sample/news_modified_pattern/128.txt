Giuliani also suggested that payments like Cohen’s to Daniels ― aimed at ensuring her silence about an alleged Trump affair ― are common practice at his firm.

Knauss was a working model when she met Donald Trump in 1998. One of her most notable jobs by 2001 was a photo in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue (Vanity Fair quipped that kissing an inflatable whale might have done the trick for her visa). She obtained HB-1 visas for skilled immigrants until she snagged the EB-1 visa about two years after first being photographed with Trump. She was later photographed nude in Trump’s private jet for a 2000 issue of British GQ.

Her special visa paved the way for her to sponsor her parents’ move to the U.S., a process that Donald Trump now opposes as “chain migration.” The first lady’s parents have obtained permanent resident status in the U.S. and are about to become citizens, sources told The Washington Post.

Michael Wildes, an attorney for Melania Trump, told the Post that the first lady was “more than amply qualified and solidly eligible” for the EB-1 program.

“That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” he said. It wasn’t until Deadspin put this video together that everyone freaked out about it. It’s been brutal. We got about 60 emails ― hateful emails ― yesterday, dozens of phone calls, people yelling profanity at us. “Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of this with my clients.”

Partners at Greenberg Traurig were reportedly displeased with the implications of Giuliani’s comments, according to The New York Times.

“We cannot speak for Mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks,” a Greenberg Traurig spokeswoman told the Times on Thursday. “Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client.

“Never mind that Roseanne and I got married two years later (and lasted four),” he wrote.

Arnold and Barr have had a rocky relationship since their divorce in 1994. In fact, 20 years later, the two comedians got into a heated fight on Twitter after Barr assumed that Arnold had donated an old tape of their wedding to Goodwill.

Yet despite that fiery past, Arnold gave the “Roseanne” reboot a positive review — mostly, however, because of Metcalf’s performance.A well-funded Pennsylvania Democrat with deep establishment support withdrew from the state district’s Democratic primary Tuesday, after reports that she was going to face a challenge to her eligibility to appear on the ballot.

Christina Hartman was running in Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District. Her decision to leave the race follows news that her rival Democrat George Scott planned to join a complaint questioning whether she received the required number of signatures under state law to appear on the ballot. The deadline for ballot challenges is Tuesday.

A separate forthcoming challenge was also going to call into question the ballot signatures, as well as the veracity of an affidavit saying Hartman lived in the district, according to a Pennsylvania Democrat familiar with the challenge.

“There appears to have been a larger and much more broad challenge coming from other candidates in the race that may have indicated the beginning of the end for Christina’s campaign,” the Democrat said.”Musical artist Teddy Geiger appeared publicly Tuesday for the first time since she announced her transition six months ago.
