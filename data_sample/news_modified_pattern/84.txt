WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Wednesday again insisted the multiple investigations into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia are “the single greatest witch hunt in American history” and suggested that Republicans “take control” of the investigations.

At a news conference with Norway’s prime minister, Trump said it was “unlikely” that he would give an interview to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators, something that is reportedly under consideration.

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.

In response to reporters’ questions, the president insisted multiple times that “there was no collusion,” claimed without evidence that “virtually everybody” has proved this, and repeated that Democrats and his presidential campaign opponent Hillary Clinton were the ones who colluded.

“The witch hunt continues,” he said, echoing a tweet from Wednesday morning, in which he also suggested Republicans should scuttle the investigation.

The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 10, 2018

Trump’s comments came on the same day that Senate Democrats released a report warning of future Russian interference in U.S. elections and chastising Trump for creating “a leadership vacuum” by repeatedly downplaying the issue.

On Wednesday morning, Trump also lashed out at Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) after she released a transcript of a Senate Judiciary Committee interview with the co-founder of the firm that produced the dossier describing Russian efforts to help the Trump campaign in the lead-up to the 2016 election.

Former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the dossier on behalf of Glenn Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS. Simpson spoke to the Judiciary Committee about the work in August.

Feinstein’s decision to make Simpson’s testimony public went against the wishes of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who said it “undermines the integrity of the committee’s oversight work.”

Trump, who coined the new nickname “Sneaky Dianne Feinstein,” called the document release “underhanded and possibly illegal” and a “disgrace” in a tweet Wednesday. He then suggested that, given no collusion has yet been proven, the “Republicans should finally take control.”

Simpson’s testimony didn’t offer any additional knowledge about whether collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government did occur. But Trump weighing into the discussion furthers the growing partisan divide around the investigations into election meddling. Republicans have attempted to discredit the dossier as a tool the FBI shouldn’t have trusted.The New York Times has canceled a panel discussion featuring James Franco after women, including actress Violet Paley, tweeted accusations of inappropriate behavior following his 2018 Golden Globes win on Sunday.

Franco and his brother Dave were scheduled to appear as guests during a “TimesTalk” event Wednesday night.

Carter said they’re currently “trying out some ideas for musicians to be cast” into to the movie. James, who made his movie debut in the 2015 comedy “Trainwreck,” could also possibly have a cameo in the new film.

The basketball star hinted at a possible cameo on Tuesday via Twitter, when he shared the news using the hashtag #MayEvenHaveToMakeACameo.

This is gonna be fun!! Stephen and Jamal are so talented. Very excited to work with them on this. Stay tuned! #MayEvenHaveToMakeACameo https://t. That’s a big reason why we’re doing this.”

The “House Party” remake isn’t the only Hollywood project James has in the works. Last May, Entertainment Weekly confirmed the Cleveland Cavaliers player will be starring in the long-awaited “Space Jam 2.” The film will be a sequel to the hit 1996 film “Space Jam,” which starred basketball legend Michael Jordan.Another Winter Olympics, another tussle over the masks of U.S. They were going to be interviewed by Times culture reporter Sopan Deb.”

How curious, then, that the attorney to the trolls was traveling to Anglin’s hometown of Columbus.

On Monday, Randazza settled into his seat on Delta 6016 and swiped through his Twitter feed. What a weekend he’d had. On Saturday, he’d partied in Hell’s Kitchen at the “Night for Freedom” bash thrown by another client, the far-right propagandist and PizzaGate pusher Mike Cernovich. Some big pro-Trump “free speech advocates” were there, speechifying about “brown people” and “faggots” and the genitalia of transgender women. According to the TimesTalk website, the discussion was slated to focus on the duo’s “Golden Globe-nominated and critically acclaimed film, ‘The Disaster Artist,’ as well as their familial bond, behind–the–scenes antics, and how there is more than one way to become a legend — and no limit to what you can achieve when you have absolutely no idea what you’re doing.”

After Franco won the Golden Globe for best actor in a motion picture/comedy for his role in “The Disaster Artist” on Sunday, Paley tweeted about the actor’s alleged history of sexually inappropriate behavior.

Cute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old? — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018

thank you for your support ❤️ just to be clear I wasn’t 17, I was an adult. There are a lot more details that will be out soon. Working with people to do it in the best, safest way — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018

another reason it’s been hard to come forward about this. we did have a consensual relationship as well.

Secondly, the legislation extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a victim realizes he or she was abused. I wanted to see her catch a damn break but I guess this is “Robbin’ Season.”

Julia: I appreciated the nuance in this episode and how it used a party with “Drake” to highlight how superficial everything on social media is though. So we start with this very typical IG live shot of ole girl promoting her promo codes, making kissy faces, getting them views up, finessing some nigga’s Netflix password. Then we flash to Van, who is really worried about what Earn’s homeless ass is doing.

Taryn: I hate that she misses his ashy ass, but I get it, I guess. I really enjoyed the engagement between her and her friends before the party. It’s not uncommon in child sexual abuse cases for survivors to have a delayed realization of the abuse they endured. Many of Nassar’s victims did not realize they had been abused until other women came forward with their stories.

Lastly, the bill limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent. Nassar often abused young girls while he was alone with them during medical visits, and many survivors said the isolation of elite gymnasts allowed the abuse to continue. unfortunately & fortunately, there are others who went through this same thing as me with him, and worse. I’m glad I am strong enough to speak up for all of us despite trolls — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 9, 2018

A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone “apology”. I don’t accept, but maybe some other people’s lives would be made easier if he donated all of his earnings from “The Disaster Artist” to @RAINN01. — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 9, 2018

Many others called out the actor for wearing a Time’s Up pin in support of women speaking about about sexual harassment and misconduct when the actor was accused of trying to get a 17-year-old to visit his hotel room in 2014.

It’s ... rich of James Franco to be wearing a Time’s Up pin 😐 — Doree Shafrir (@doree) January 8, 2018

Whatever I still remember James Franco trying to pick up a teenager on Instagram — Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 8, 2018

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, a spokesperson for the Times said that the organization was “not comfortable” pursuing the event amid “recent allegations.”

“The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, The Disaster Artist. Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we’re no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,” the spokesperson said.

Deb tweeted that he approached Franco at an event Tuesday night in Manhattan and asked if he’d like to respond to the allegations. Franco declined.
