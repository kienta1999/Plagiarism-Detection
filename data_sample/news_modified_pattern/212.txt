As the model and daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin attempted to navigate the red carpet in her stunning Tommy Hilfiger gown, Mendes was caught on camera making sure that the fabric of her train fell just right.

The “Stitches” singer took precautions not to step on her dress as well.

Pandit Dasa, a Hindu American and a mindfulness expert based in New Jersey, said that what’s happening with Holi now is similar to yoga’s rise in popularity.

“Yoga is referenced in the scriptures of Hinduism as a practice that helps you come closer to the divine or God. Obviously [most] yoga studios today have nothing to do with that philosophy,” he said last year.

And if all that weren’t sweet enough, Mendes, 19, walked backward up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in order to help Baldwin, 21, navigate the stairs.

According to People, the couple — who made their red carpet debut Monday night — have been romantically linked since late 2017.

Although neither celebrity’s camp has officially confirmed their relationship as of yet, both posted photos from the event in which they looked pretty cozy with one another.

A+ train game, guys! Eduardo Munoz / ReutersSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is apologizing for comments he made on Monday that Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) reported request to have Donald Trump stay away from his funeral is “ridiculous.”

Hatch pointed out that Trump is not only the president of the United States but also “a very good man.”

McCain, 81, was diagnosed with brain cancer last July and has been discussing his final plans, including his funeral. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have been asked to do eulogies, and Hatch suggested the 45th president should also give one.

“He would be a very interesting speaker and would do a good job for John,” Hatch told CNN.

Hatch changed his tune on Tuesday after McCain’s daughter, Meghan, called him out on ABC’s “The View.”

“I’d like everybody to take a collective breath and chill out on my dad for a second — especially Orrin Hatch,” she said on the show.

.@MeghanMcCain shares an update on her father Sen. John McCain as he fights brain cancer — saying he's having a "great recovery" and "making jokes: "I'd like everybody to take a collective breath and chill out on my dad for a second.

“I’d love to see a reboot of ‘Dear Genevieve,’ or something similar,” he told HuffPost, referencing “Trading Spaces” alum Genevieve Gorder’s show, in which she helped lucky homeowners redesign a run-down space in their house. “I’d also like to see a show that goes back to basics: Show a real-life interior designer providing realistic ― cost-effective and available ― advice and sources. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner revealed in December that the Trump campaign had brokered an agreement with Sinclair to provide greater access to Trump and the campaign if the company’s channels aired uninterrupted interviews with Trump.

After Trump’s election, Sinclair hired former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn as a political commentator. The company requires its local TV stations to air Epshteyn’s pro-Trump analysis nine times a week.

What distinguishes Sinclair from the overtly conservative Fox News, however, is that it claims to be an objective local news provider.

“All of us thought that local media was off limits,” Heenan told HuffPost in an interview.

Heenan said the goal of his ad is to educate voters about the issue of corporate interference in media and give voice to concerns that some Sinclair employees have expressed. He decided not to mention Trump in the ad, because he believes that the issue would be the same if it were top-down corporate pressure on behalf of a Democrat. (Omitting Trump offers potential political benefits too: Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016.)

“The thing that bothers me is corporate media forcing reporters to say political talking points instead of honest straightforward news.” - John Heenan

“Does it bother me that local newscasters here were forced to read these talking points? Yeah,” Heenan said. “But whether it was Donald Trump talking points or frankly, Barack Obama points, the thing that bothers me is corporate media forcing reporters to say political talking points instead of honest, straightforward news.”

For Heenan, who successfully sued the country’s five largest banks for fraudulently foreclosing on Montana homeowners, the issue of corporate power in media fits nicely into his campaign themes.

Heenan has made the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics a key plank of his campaign, claiming that the “system is rigged” against ordinary people.

And in Gianforte, Heenan has the perfect foil for a debate over journalism and corporate influence. In each episode, the viewers could explore fabric showrooms, furniture and flooring shops, etc. No gimmicks.”

Amber Lewis, on the other hand, wants the network to feature higher-budget homes and convey the often-pricey truth about construction, real estate and design.

“In my opinion, the biggest problem with HGTV is that it’s completely unrealistic. The budgets are so under market value for what it actually costs to get work done,” the CEO and lead designer of California-based Amber Interiors told HuffPost.

An Uber spokesperson told HuffPost that the company is gathering the information requested. It has removed the rider’s access to Uber and is “fully cooperating with law enforcement on their investigation.”

“Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination on the app, and we have reached out to the [driver] to offer our support,” the spokesperson said. “It would be refreshing for them to update their price points and get with the times! No bathroom costs $5,000 to completely remodel, and not a single kitchen on earth can be remodeled in a couple weekends with a $10,000 budget! How about high-end, large-budget projects and a host that shows the back end of how that’s done, almost like a ‘Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,’ just no Robin Leach, or caviar wishes and Champagne dreams!”

For Page and Feld, the most important thing is to give the audience what it wants: an escape.

“The viewers see us as this comfort food, especially in times of upheaval and turmoil and whatever else is going on in the world,” Feld said of the network..." https://t.co/Vhegu08m1B pic. In exchange for that adjustment, Democrats got an expansion of a low-income housing credit.

When Hatch heard this, he realized the error of his ways.

“I felt badly. I had spoken out of turn,” the Utah Republican told reporters, according to CNN. “I felt like I shouldn’t have said what I said.”

Hatch also sent a letter to McCain apologizing for butting in regarding the funeral plans and for suggesting that McCain would not return to the Senate, according to The Washington Post.
