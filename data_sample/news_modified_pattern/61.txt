The following are comments I made today at the Department of Education rule-making meeting on student loan issues.

Many for-profit colleges get 80 percent, 90 percent, or more of their revenue from taxpayers. Taxpayers have a right to expect adequate performance and avoidance of waste, fraud, and abuse.

Some for-profit schools do a good job. To know what it feels like to be an American citizen and have their voice heard. Whether they choose to or not, they will have that opportunity. Whoever they vote for, it don’t matter, as long as they have the opportunity to vote.”

Florida is one of just four states that permanently disenfranchises felons. Under the current system, felons who have completely finished their sentences can apply to have their rights restored, but the process is cumbersome and has moved at a glacial pace under Gov. Rick Scott (R).

AdvertisementPeople in Limerick, Ireland, honored local hero Dolores O’Riordan in the most beautifully fitting way Monday night.

Some 200 people gathered in Arthur’s Quay Park to remember the Cranberries’ lead vocalist with a singalong of the band’s biggest tracks. O’Riordan died last Monday at the age of 46. The cause of death has not yet been made public.

Mourners sang the group’s 1993 smash hit “Linger,” as seen in touching footage shared by the “ILOVELIMERICK” Facebook page.

Limerick-based singer Emma Langford defied folks not to “get a little choked up” at a video of people singing the group’s 1996 song “When You’re Gone.”

Hundreds gathered in Limerick's Arthur's Quay Park singing When You're Gone.

I defy you to not get a little choked up at this. But there’s enormous evidence that many for-profit schools, getting billions in federal aid, have engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices and that many students have been left with terrible outcomes, including insurmountable debt. That’s the problem.

The Department had to act, and it did, with the gainful employment rule, and the 2016 borrower defense rule.

Ms. Weisman told you this week you should get the rule right, because the Department should not have to start a new rulemaking any time soon to fix it, as it has many other regulatory issues to address.

But that is what the Department is doing now: revisiting an issue it decided less than 15 months ago, and decided correctly, after listening carefully to all stakeholders.

Secretary DeVos has claimed that under the 2016 rule “all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.” That is not so. A student would have to show school misconduct, and relief would remain an uphill battle for many students who were in fact injured.

School operators insist in this meeting essentially that former students would act as con artists, and exploit the rule to bring down good schools like theirs, even when the school leadership did nothing wrong. What kind of scam would that be?

A student would have to put in all the hours of classes, studying, commuting; find child care; commit personal and family money, Pell grants, GI bill; and take out the high-interest private loans often needed to attend expensive schools. Most of that time and money would never be regained. — lynnethedreamer (@lynne816) February 8, 2018

Teigen has never shied away from calling out Legend on social media. When the musician posted a beautiful ― but low-quality ― photo on Instagram for his wife’s birthday, Teigen simply commented “How about a hi-res,” a reference to the blurriness of the picture.

They also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn’t find one of the couple’s toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.

And despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won’t ever leave Legend.States with high rates of residential segregation are significantly more likely to have fatal police shootings of unarmed black victims, according to a new Boston University study.

The Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) research team said their study is the first of its kind to find a link between structural racism, particularly residential segregation, and racial disparities in fatal police shootings at the state level.

“This suggests that the higher rates of fatal police shootings of unarmed Black victims are not merely a result of more interactions between police officers and Black suspects,” wrote study co-author Anita Knopov, a pre-doctoral fellow at SPH in a Monday blog post.

“Instead, our results indicate that in some states, there is a systematically different response based on the race of the suspect,” Knopov said. All this alleged scam could achieve is possible cancellation of federal loans — far from the whole thing, and far from guaranteed.

Look at the facts. Since the Department started taking borrower defense seriously after the collapse of Corinthian and ITT, it has received about 99,000 claims. 98.6 percent are from students who attended for-profit schools. Very few are from non-profit and public colleges. But also there are many for-profit schools where not a single student has filed for debt forgiveness.

Students who attended good schools, it seems, are not seeking loan relief.

For the owners who believe their schools are honest and effective, here’s how you would avoid trouble under the 2016 rule: Be honest and effective. Don’t set out to deceive or defraud students. Train your admissions staff to behave ethically. Offer a quality, valuable education at a fair price.

There’s no reason to believe the Department would create a kangaroo court and start rubber stamping phony student debt relief claims, or that the 2016 rule would force it to. No reason. All the 2016 rule does is give the student a fair chance to be heard.

If a few students at a good school managed somehow to get their loans forgiven, taxpayers, not the school, would be on the hook for the money. Recoupment is in the Department’s discretion.

Reince Priebus ― Chief of Staff

Reince Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, spent a little more than six months as White House chief of staff before he quietly submitted his resignation. Priebus continually butted heads with other powerful voices in the West Wing, including then-Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and the short-lived communications director Anthony Scaramucci.

Then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, took over the role in July. Only if the Department saw egregious or persistent wrongdoing would it likely come after the school, and the school would be able to defend itself.

In that light, it seems clear that the 2016 rule is not a lucrative racket for crooked students at honest schools. Instead, it’s basic protection for honest students at crooked schools.

Chang and Han’s reviews gained traction among Asian-American social media users, and many added their voices to the group of frustrated viewers, including film critic Inkoo Kang and the L.A. Times’ Jen Yamato.

For me, the most obvious sign that ISLE OF DOGS is a film based on American stereotypes of Japan, rather than something rooted in Japanese culture, is the main Japanese character's name. "Atari" is not a Japanese name. It is a word that two white men gave their game company. — Inkoo Kang (@inkookang) March 23, 2018

#IsleOfDogs: Thank you @JustinCChang for devoting far more attention than most critics will to many of the willfully tone-deaf ways Wes Anderson appropriates and marginalizes Japanese culture and people in his so-called homage. It is ugly, indeed. https://t.co/GtbWVg40YF — jen yamato (@jenyamato) March 22, 2018

Wes Anderson: I'm going to make a film about how a cruel Japanese government sends dogs to an internment camp!!

Japanese Americans: Uh..

Compare that to the rule the Department proposed this week.

Mr. McComis, who runs the leading for-profit college accreditor, told you that this proposal “feels a little stacked against the student.” He described the multiple constraints to debt relief as “belts and suspenders on pants that are too tight.” He added, “I find it just not reasonable that a student would be able to achieve anything… If that’s the intent, I’m not sure why we’re here.”

The draft rule would impose one of the toughest legal standards the government has ever required of a private party – and impose them on lower-income people who lack the means to meet the burdens, whatever the justice of their claims. The draft rule also would render the 1994 law a nullity. The Department doesn’t have the power to do that.

The Department does have the power to prohibit forced arbitration clauses as a condition of receiving Title IV aid, and I commend the Department lawyers who got that right the first time. The Justice Department’s position on the Federal Arbitration Act is not on point.

One last thing: The suggestion that stronger borrower relief is worse for taxpayers is short-sighted at best, dishonest at worst. If the Department granted injured students meaningful relief, it would soon have a stronger sense of the enormous costs of allowing bad schools to participate in the federal aid program, and it would remove the worst actors more quickly. I believe that’s exactly what bad schools are afraid of. Good schools should want a strong borrower defense rule that drives out unscrupulous competitors, the ones who have given the for-profit college industry its bad reputation.

All of you, I hope, got into the education field because you believed in the power of learning to lift people up and change lives. If you stay true to those beliefs, the best course is to reject proposals that, in truth, slam the door on abused students. The existing rule can work, and would protect students, taxpayers, and good schools. 17 broadcast, which he last did in 1988 when John Forsythe was the host, according to Variety.

NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt is predicting a hilarious show, according to the network’s announcement.

“With Colin and Michael in the driver’s seat as hosts, along with surprise appearances by other cast members of ‘Saturday Night Live,’ I think we are in for one of the funniest awards shows in a long time,” he said.A federal judge on Thursday decided documents seized in FBI raids targeting lawyer Michael Cohen should be handed over to an independent reviewer, hours after President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from his personal lawyer on Fox News.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ruled an independent special master should review the material to make sure it doesn’t violate attorney-client confidentiality rules before it can be seen by prosecutors or lawyers for Cohen, who reportedly is under investigation for paying hush money to silence porn star Stormy Daniels’ claim of an affair with Trump. You should reaffirm that rule.
